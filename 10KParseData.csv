We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.12Table of Contents            BacklogWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.Materials Our life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.EnvironmentalOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws.We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.Regulatory AffairsA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union is going to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance activities. We will have until May 2022 to meet the new EU IVDR requirements.  We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.We are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-13Table of Contents            competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.Human Capital ManagementAs of October 31, 2020, we employed approximately 16,400 persons, of whom approximately 5,600 were employed in the United States and approximately 10,800 were employed outside of the United States. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off.  As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development through programs such as our Emerging Leader Program, our Managing at Agilent programs and our experienced managers’ Accelerate program. In addition, we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.  As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion.  We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.

The global spread of COVID-19 had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, sales and delivery and supply chains. Many countries including the United States implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products. Moreover, these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, we may again experience a decline in sales activities and customer orders in certain of our businesses. Continuing travel restrictions, prolonged quarantines or other government orders in response to the pandemic may significantly impact our ability to support our sites and service customers in those locations. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. If the pandemic continues or worsens, our manufacturing facilities, our distribution centers where inventory is managed and the operations of our logistics and other service providers may be significantly impacted. Accordingly, COVID-19 has negatively affected our revenue growth in certain of our businesses. It is uncertain how materially COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts persist, worsen or re-emerge over an extended period of time. The extent and duration of these impacts are dependent in part on customers returning to work and economic activity continuing to ramp up. The impact on our business also depends in part on the pace at which our customers resume non-COVID-19 related patient care and testing, as well as the timing of when research performed by laboratories and other institutions returns to normal levels.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets. A disruption of global financial markets or resulting economic downturn may reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and increase the cost of doing so. There are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.We cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent COVID-19 conditions improve, the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business. The actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information; pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient; and could have a material, adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, 16Table of Contents            research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;•innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;•appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;•manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;•price our products competitively;•anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and•control product quality in our manufacturing process.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:•reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;•increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increased price pressure for our products and services; and•greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.17Table of Contents            Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;•changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;•changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the increased uncertainty around its implementation caused by COVID-19, as well as, new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;•tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;•negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•differing protection of intellectual property;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; •geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, terrorism and war; and•impact of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19 on the global economy.We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.18Table of Contents            In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets, and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment. Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired 19Table of Contents            businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely 20Table of Contents            affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.A number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services. For example, the EU is going to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance activities. We will have until May 2022 to meet the new EU IVDR requirements. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.21Table of Contents            Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. 22Table of Contents            Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual 23Table of Contents            property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.Third parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.The U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (""the Tax Act"") significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations.  Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), as well as state tax authorities. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.24Table of Contents            We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.We are party to a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024.  As of October 31, 2020, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. On August 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provided for a $500 million short-term loan facility that was used in full to complete the acquisition of BioTek and was repaid in full as of October 31, 2020. On October 21, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement, which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to $500 million. We had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of October 31, 2020. On May 1, 2020, we entered into a new $1.0 billion commercial paper program, and as of October 31, 2020 we had $75 million of commercial paper outstanding. We also have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion in senior unsecured notes. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:•increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry.Our credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other natural or man-made disasters. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to an extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, which impacted our business and results, reduced the number of selling days and otherwise impacted our supply chain. As described above, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations, supply chain and financial results and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.25Table of Contents            If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.General RisksAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.As of October 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,441 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.We are subject to the rules of the SEC which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.",>Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.26Table of Contents            ,">Item 2.

Overview and Executive SummaryAgilent Technologies Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.COVID-19 PandemicBoth our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. Many countries, including the United States, implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations at different times. Due to these measures, we experienced unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products, disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products, and delays in installations and services due to the inability to access customer sites, primarily in the latter part of our second quarter. As an essential business throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained open with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees, customers and community. At every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate precautions, including a mandatory work from home policy for all employees with the exception of manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as restrictions on all non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities. At this time, our factories continue to operate around the world in accordance with the guidance issued by local, state and national government authorities. Our digital workplace strategy and strategic technology investments have enabled us to provide modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees to meet remote working needs as this situation has escalated. We have taken and continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our global employee base. We designed a multi-phase return-to-office process for the safe return of our employees to our sites. We developed and implemented rigorous return-to-office protocols to promote a safe work environment in all locations for employees who have been working on-site throughout the pandemic and for employees who will be returning in the future, as well as, for the safety of all customer and vendor interactions.At this time, the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly impacted our manufacturing facilities or third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers. We continue working with our customers and suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our delivery and supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The majority of the markets we serve, such as the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, food, environmental and diagnostics and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels throughout the pandemic, and we continue working closely with 31Table of Contents            our customers to ensure their seamless operations. From a customer-facing perspective, we continue leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demonstrations across all regions, remote instrument repairs, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and rapid one-on-one communications over emails, phone and video conferencing.Despite the economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we ended fiscal year 2020 with revenue growth of 3 percent year over year with revenue growth from most of our key end markets. In the latter part of the fiscal year, our Agilent CrossLab business began to see an increase in revenue for our on-demand services and installation services due to the re-opening of laboratories around the world, especially in Europe. While we began to see elective medical procedures resume in the fourth quarter, revenue from our diagnostics and genomics business continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In our life sciences and applied markets business, we saw an increase in demand for some of our products for use in the COVID-19 testing, vaccine and therapeutic drug development.  We also benefited from our cost savings actions which included reduction in travel and non-essential spending.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. Although we anticipate there will be vaccines distributed widely in the near future, we expect continued volatility and unpredictability related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business results. We continue to actively monitor the pandemic and we will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the adverse impacts on our business posed by the on-going spread of COVID-19. 2030 Senior NotesOn June 4, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2030 senior notes""). The 2030 senior notes were issued at 99.812% of their principal amount. The 2030 senior notes will mature on June 4, 2030, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.10% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on June 4th and December 4th of each year and payments commenced on December 4, 2020.AcquisitionsIn 2019, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences Inc. (""ACEA""), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million. In addition, we completed the acquisition of privately-owned Lionheart Technologies LLC (""BioTek""), a leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of innovative life science instrumentation for $1.17 billion. The financial results of these businesses have been included in our financial results from the date of the close.

Net income was $719 million in 2020 compared to net income of $1,071 million and $316 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net income in 2020 was impacted by revenue declines in certain of our businesses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs and expenses which included an impairment charge of $98 million related to the closure of our 32Table of Contents            sequencer development program. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2019 was impacted by a discrete tax benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company's tax incentives in Singapore. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2018 was impacted by a discrete tax charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act that was passed on December 22, 2017. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,441 million and $1,382 million, respectively.   On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization.  As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired approximately 5.2 million shares for $469 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2020, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $558 million of our common stock under this program. During the year ended October 31, 2020, cash dividends of 0.720 per share, or $222 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2019, cash dividends of 0.656 per share, or $206 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2018, cash dividends of 0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 18, 2020 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.194 per share of common stock, or approximately $59 million which will be paid on January 27, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 5, 2021. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Looking forward, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers and community, as well as supporting our customers' operations. We also remain focused on improving our customers’ experience, differentiating product solutions and productivity especially during these extraordinary times. Our focus on meeting our customers’ needs supported several aspects of the COVID-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. While uncertainties remain as the spread of COVID-19 begins to rise, we are cautiously optimistic that in the short-term our financial results can continue to improve as the global economy continues its path towards recovery. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.Revenue Recognition.  On November 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""ASC 606""). We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.33Table of Contents            We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.  Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the  revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the consumables, the  non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard.Inventory Valuation.  We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. 34Table of Contents            Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions.  Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2020 and 2019, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2020, discount rates for the U.S. plans decreased compared to the previous year due to the decrease in the corporate bond rates. For 2020 and 2019, the discount rates for non-U.S. plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2020, decreased marginally compared to the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in U.S. pension expense and $17 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 24 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 38 percent to 65 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2020 and 2019 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on U.S. pension expense and $9 million on non-U.S. pension expense. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $22 million expense in 2020, $10 million expense in 2019 and $3 million benefit in 2018. The year ended October 31, 2020 included a loss on settlement of $4 million. The year ended October 31, 2018 included a settlement gain of $5 million.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.35Table of Contents            If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2020, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of September 30, 2020. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2020. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is indicated. During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. During the year ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate is highly dependent 36Table of Contents            upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.  We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis.  If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.Adoption of New PronouncementsSee Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements,"" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.Foreign CurrencyOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling thirteen-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. 37Table of Contents            Results from OperationsNet Revenue Years Ended October 31,2020 over 2019 Change2019 over 2018    Change 202020192018 (in millions)  Net revenue:     Products$3,993 $3,877 $3,746 3%3%Services and other$1,346 $1,286 $1,168 5%10%Total net revenue$5,339 $5,163 $4,914 3%5%  Years Ended October 31,2020 over 2019 Change2019 over 2018    Change 202020192018% of total net revenue:     Products75 %75 %76 %—(1) pptServices and other25 %25 %24 %—1 pptTotal100 %100 %100 %  Agilent's net revenue of $5,339 million for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased 3 percent when compared to 2019.

Income Taxes  Years Ended October 31, 202020192018 (in millions)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$123 $(152)$630 For 2020, the company's income tax expense was $123 million with an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates.For 2019, the company's income tax benefit was $152 million with an effective tax rate of (16.5) percent. For the year ended October 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.For 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) consisting of (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $71 million, $368 million, and $87 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.23, $1.16, and $0.27 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.41Table of Contents            The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.Segment OverviewThrough October 31, 2020, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business.

In Europe we saw strong growth in the biomolecular analysis business offset by softness in the genomics business. In Asia Pacific the growth was driven by our biomolecular analysis business and negatively impacted by softness in the genomics business.The revenue growth in 2019 was led by strong revenue performance in our nucleic acid solutions, companion diagnostics and biomolecular analysis business. The diagnostics and clinical research market remains strong and growing driven by an aging population and unhealthy lifestyle developments such as poor diet and physical inactivity.Looking forward, although we see short-term impacts to routine and cancer testing due to COVID-19 which will affect our revenue growth, we are optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities in our end markets and continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. We remain positive about our growth in our end markets as our product portfolio around OMNIS, PD-L1 assays and SureFISH continue to gain strength with our customers in clinical oncology applications, and our next generation sequencing target enrichment solutions continue to be adopted. Market demand in the nucleic acid solutions business related to therapeutic oligo programs continues, and with our newly opened and planned extension of our nucleic acid solutions production facility in Frederick, Colorado, we are well positioned to serve more of the market demand. We will continue to invest in research and development and seek to expand our position in developing countries and emerging markets.Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the diagnostics and genomics business' margins, expenses and income from operations for 2020 versus 2019, and 2019 versus 2018. Years Ended October 31,2020 over 2019 Change2019 over 2018    Change 202020192018(in millions, except margin data)Total gross margin51.9 %54.7 %56.3 %(3) ppts(2) pptsResearch and development$114 $125 $109 (9)%15%Selling, general and administrative$238 $248 $249 (4)%—Operating margin18.3 %18.2 %18.4 %——Income from operations$192 $185 $173 3%7%Gross margin decreased 3 percentage points in 2020 when compared to 2019. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable product mix and higher fixed costs related to the new manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado, partially offset by lower period and travel costs. Gross margin decreased 2 percentage points in 2019 when compared to 2018. The decrease in gross margin was driven by an unfavorable product mix and a higher fixed cost structure due to the addition of a second nucleic acid manufacturing facility that offset gains from higher sales volumes.Research and development expenses decreased 9 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Research and development expenses decreased due to the shutdown of our sequencer development program and a reduction in discretionary expenditures including travel costs. Research and development expenses increased 15 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018.  The increase was due to additional expenses related to prior year's acquisitions, higher wages and variable pay and increased spending around the development of clinical applications and solutions.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to a reduction in discretionary expenditures including travel costs partially offset by an increase in wages. Selling, general and administrative expenses were flat in 2019 when compared to 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses were impacted by efficiency gains offsetting higher wages and variable pay.Operating margin was relatively flat in 2020 when compared to 2019. Operating margin was aided by savings in operating expenses which were offset by gross margin decline. Operating margin was relatively flat in 2019 when compared to 2018. Operating margin was impacted by higher sales volume, offsetting the gross margin deterioration and the increase in research and development spending.45Table of Contents            Income from OperationsIncome from operations in 2020 increased by $7 million or 3 percent when compared to 2019 on a revenue increase of $26 million. The increase was driven by gains from higher volume and lower operating expenses more than offsetting the gross margin percentage decline. Income from operations in 2019 increased by $12 million or 7 percent when compared to 2018 on a revenue increase of $78 million.  The increase was due to higher volume partially offset by the gross margin percentage decline and higher research and development expenses.Agilent CrossLabThe Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.

Foreign currency movements for 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point when compared to 2019.  Geographically, revenue was flat in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, increased 2 percent in Europe with a 1 percentage point favorable currency impact and increased 7 percent in Asia Pacific with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. As a consequence of the COVID-19 related impact on global commerce in 2020, consumable sales growth has been low single digits in comparison to 2019 in most countries excluding China. In addition, the COVID-19 related customer site closures have brought a temporary lull in our delivery of on-demand services and installation services, which has been recovering in the latter half of the year as customer labs reopen. Consumable sales in China and the contracted service business across most regions have seen solid gains throughout 2020. Among our major end markets, the pharmaceutical market and the food market generated the strongest revenue growth when compared to 2019.Agilent CrossLab business revenue in 2019 increased 8 percent when compared to 2018. Foreign currency movements for 2019 had an overall unfavorable impact of 3 percentage points when compared to 2018. Acquisitions in 2018 added 1 percentage point to the revenue growth reported for 2019. Revenue growth in 2019 was driven broadly by our entire services and consumables portfolio.  Geographically, revenue increased 9 percent in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, increased 5 percent in Europe with a 5 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 10 percent in Asia Pacific with a 3 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. Agilent CrossLab business saw strong revenue growth in all key end markets, except in the diagnostics and clinical market, when compared to 2018. Looking forward, the Agilent CrossLab portfolio of products and services capabilities is well positioned to continue to succeed in our key end markets.  With less predictable access to customer sites during the global COVID-19 pandemic, the business is taking advantage of digital and remote capabilities to offer services and consumables to customers. Despite the current COVID-19 environment, we remain confident about the long-term growth opportunities as customer feedback remains very positive on the value Agilent CrossLab brings to customer labs. Geographically, the business is well diversified across all regions to take advantage of local market opportunities as they reopen to commerce.46Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the Agilent CrossLab business' margins, expenses and income from operations for 2020 versus 2019 and 2019 versus 2018. Years Ended October 31,2020 over 2019 Change2019 over 2018    Change 202020192018(in millions, except margin data)Total gross margin52.2 %51.8 %50.4 %—1 pptResearch and development$58 $58 $56 —3%Selling, general and administrative$417 $421 $413 (1)%2%Operating margin27.2 %25.8 %22.8 %1 ppt3 pptsIncome from operations$516 $475 $388 9%23%Gross margin for products and services was relatively flat in 2020 when compared to 2019. Gross margin benefited from lower service delivery costs which include travel, parts and labor as well as improved productivity in manufacturing in the consumables business. Those operational gains were offset by a net unfavorable impact from currency movements. Gross margin for products and services increased 1 percentage point in 2019 when compared to 2018. Gross margin was impacted by higher sales volume, combined with efficiency gains in the service delivery operation and in the logistics and manufacturing processes for the consumables business. Some of those gains were offset by higher wages and higher variable costs and increased headcount.Research and development expenses were relatively flat in 2020 when compared to 2019. The higher wages and variable pay in research and development expenses were offset by lower travel costs and the reduction of other discretionary expenditures. Research and development expenses increased 3 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018. Research and development increased due to higher wages and higher variable pay and additional research and development expenditures from acquisitions made in 2018.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2020 when compared to 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to favorable currency movements, reduced travel and training by the sales organization, lower sales commissions, and a reduction in discretionary expenditures which were partially offset by higher wages. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2019 when compared to 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher due to additional operating expenses from our acquisitions made in 2018, in addition to higher wages and higher variable pay. Those increases were partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency movements.Operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to the growth in revenue while lowering service delivery and selling costs and the reduction of discretionary expenditures, partially offset by higher wages. Operating margin increased 3 percentage points in 2019 when compared to 2018. The increase in operating margin was driven by the higher sales volume, combined with efficiency gains across the service delivery operations, order fulfillment processes and other operations.Income from OperationsIncome from operations in 2020 increased by $41 million or 9 percent when compared to 2019 on a revenue increase of $60 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth in revenue while lowering service delivery and selling costs and the reduction of discretionary expenditures, partially offset by higher wages. Income from operations in 2019 increased by $87 million or 23 percent when compared to 2018 on a revenue increase of $139 million. The increase was driven by the higher sales volume, combined with efficiency gains across the service delivery operations, order fulfillment processes and other operations.47Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesWe believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially impacted by COVID-19 to date. We have not identified any material liquidity concerns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results.Economic stimulus legislation was passed in many countries in response to COVID-19. In March in the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") was enacted to provide for tax relief and government loans, subsidies and other relief for entities in affected industries. As of October 31, 2020, the CARES Act and other government benefits outside the U.S. did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Our financial position as of October 31, 2020 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1,441 million as compared to $1,382 million as of October 31, 2019.As of October 31, 2020, approximately $1,395 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. We utilize a variety of funding strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.We may, from time to time, retire certain outstanding debt of ours through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $921 million in 2020 as compared to $1,021 million provided in 2019 and $1,087 million provided in 2018. We paid approximately $79 million under our variable and incentive pay programs in 2020, as compared to a total of $118 million in 2019 and $103 million in 2018. The decrease in the amount for variable and incentive pay programs paid in 2020 is primarily due to changes made for certain incentive pay programs which are now paid annually versus semi-annually as was done in 2019 and 2018. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $361 million in 2020 which included a one-time payment of $231 million related to the transfer of intellectual property compared to incomes taxes paid of $159 million in 2019 and $102 million in 2018. For the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, the net change in tax related assets and liabilities due to the Tax Act was zero compared to $552 million in the same period of 2018.  In 2018, $552 million in tax-related assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act, which primarily consisted of an estimated provision of $499 million of U.S. transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as well as an estimated $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate income tax rate. Deferred tax inflows were $29 million in 2020 compared to cash outflows of $255 million 2019, which included $266 million related to the extension of the company's tax incentive in Singapore, and cash outflows of $16 million in 2018. In 2020, there was a net unrealized gain on fair value of equity investments of $28 million. In 2020, there was an impairment charge of $99 million mainly related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program compared to impairment charges of zero in 2019, and $21 million in 2018. For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, other assets and liabilities used cash of $181 million, $43 million and $4 million, respectively. The cash outflow in the year ended October 31, 2020 was largely the result of increased income tax payments, interest payments on senior notes and changes in deferred revenue.  Cash outflow for the year ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 in other assets and liabilities is primarily due to tax payments and interest on senior notes.In 2020, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $107 million, $106 million in 2019, and $65 million in 2018. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 63 days in 2020, 61 days in 2019 and 54 days in 2018. The change in accounts payable provided cash of $2 million in 2020, $29 million in 2019 and $40 million in 2018. Cash used in inventory was $68 million in 2020, $36 million in 2019 and $83 million in 2018. Inventory days on-hand decreased to 93 days in 2020 compared to 97 days in 2019 and decreased compared to 98 days in 2018. In the year ended October 31, 2020, we increased our inventory levels to meet our customer needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.48We made no contributions to our U.S defined benefit plans in 2020, 2019 and 2018. We contributed $31 million in 2020 and $21 million each year in 2019 and 2018 to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, respectively. We did not contribute to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. The increase in 2020 mainly related to $12 million additional contribution in the Netherlands. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2021.  We expect to contribute $22 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2021.        Net Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 was $147 million and in 2019 was $1,590 million as compared to net cash used of $705 million in 2018. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $119 million in 2020, $155 million in 2019 and $177 million in 2018. In 2020 we made no acquisitions of businesses. In 2019 we invested $1,408 million in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of two businesses compared to the acquisition of seven businesses for $516 million in 2018.  In 2020 cash used to purchase fair value investments was $20 million compared to $23 million outlay in 2019 and $11 million in 2018. Net Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities in 2020 was $717 million compared to $299 million in 2019 and $797 million in 2018. Treasury Stock Repurchases On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization.  As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired approximately 5.2 million shares for $469 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2020, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $558 million of our common stock under this program.Dividends For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 cash dividends of $222 million, $206 million and $191 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 18, 2020 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.194 per share of common stock, or approximately $59 million which will be paid on January 27, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 5, 2021. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.49Credit FacilitiesOn March 13, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024. For the year ended October 31, 2020, we borrowed $798 million and repaid $913 million under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2020, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.   On August 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provides for a $500 million short-term loan facility that was used in full to complete the BioTek acquisition and which was repaid in full as of October 31, 2020. On October 21, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement, which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to $500 million. We had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of October 31, 2020. On April 17, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to the credit agreement which provides the company with the option to request the consent of the applicable class of lenders to extend the maturity date of revolving borrowings and swingline loans for an additional period of one year and of the 2019 incremental term loans for an additional period of up to 364 days. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the year ended October 31, 2020.Commercial PaperIn May 2020, we established a U.S. commercial paper program, under which the company may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.0 billion with up to 397-day maturities.  At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2020, borrowings outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.17 percent and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately five days.

The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the 50life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2020 was $6 million. 2029 Senior NotesOn September 16, 2019, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2029 senior notes"").

The interest is payable semi-annually on June 4th and December 4th of each year and payments commenced on December 4, 2020.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and OtherOur liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2020 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):Less than oneyearOne to three yearsThree to five yearsMore than five yearsCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers$541 $15 $1 $— Other purchase commitments85 — — — Retirement plans22 — — — Transitional pension contributions to our U.S. 401(k) plan6 3 — — Total$654 $18 $1 $— Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.51Other Purchase Commitments. We have categorized ""other purchase commitments"" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under ""other purchase commitments"" were approximately $85 million within the next year. Approximately $23 million of the contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 13 years.Retirement Plans.  Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2020 or October 31, 2019.On Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2020 balance sheet (in millions):Less than oneyearOne to three yearsThree to five yearsMore than five yearsSenior notes$— $1,000 $— $1,300 Commercial paper75 — — — Interest expense69 126 67 117 Transition tax— 7 68 49 Operating leases54 69 25 49 Total$198 $1,202 $160 $1,515 Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019 include $323 million and $328 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities.  Of these amounts, $199 million related to uncertain tax positions as of both October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. The remaining $124 million in other long-term liabilities relates to the one-time transition tax payable. ",">Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is mainly managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 52 percent of our revenue in 2020, 51 percent of our revenue in 2019 and 53 percent of our revenue in 2018 were generated in U.S. dollars. The overall unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point in the year ended October 31, 2020. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. 52We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.  We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.53",">Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataIndex to Consolidated Financial StatementsPageConsolidated Financial Statements: Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm55Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 202057Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 202058Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2020 and 201959Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 202060Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 202061Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements62Quarterly Summary (unaudited)11354REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Agilent Technologies, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting PrincipleAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2020 and the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2019.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 55preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $240 million as of October 31, 2020. As disclosed by management, the estimate of the Company’s tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions requires management to assess uncertainties and to make judgments about the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various other foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examinations of its tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. The Company has a number of years and matters which remain subject to examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions that could result in significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when determining uncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the numerous and complex tax laws, tax audits, and potential for significant adjustments as a result of such audits. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate the timely identification and accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions is complex and required significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often highly subjective, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liability for uncertain tax positions, and controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the liability. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of information used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including intercompany agreements, international, federal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax returns, testing the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions by jurisdiction, including management’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained, testing the completeness of management’s assessment of both the identification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes of each uncertain tax position, and evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's uncertain tax positions related to the application of relevant tax laws./s/

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1.     OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESOverview.  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Basis of Presentation.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes.Risks and Uncertainties. We are subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, such as global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in customer demand, among others.Both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. As a result, academic and research laboratories had temporarily closed in our second and third quarters and hospitals and testing laboratories had halted or reduced certain elective medical procedures, which had an adverse effect on our customers' business. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which could result in a prolonged economic downturn that could disrupt our business.Revenue Recognition.  We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606’’). See also Note 4, ""Revenue"" for additional information on revenue recognition.Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to 62AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Standalone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract, and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases for 2020 and ASC 840, Leases for prior periods. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance.Deferred Revenue.  Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements (performance obligations) to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either in current liabilities in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation. Sales Taxes.  Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.Shipping and Handling Costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.Research and Development.  Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Advertising.  Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $48 million in 2020, $36 million in 2019 and $41 million in 2018.63AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Taxes on Income.  Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 6, ""Income Taxes"" for more information.Net Income Per Share.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 7, ""Net Income Per Share"".Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.  We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.As of October 31, 2020, approximately $1,395 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.We classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Currently, we have no short-term investments.Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash to the consolidated balance sheet follows:October 31,202020192018(in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$1,441 $1,382 $2,247 Restricted cash included in other assets6 6 7 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$1,447 $1,388 $2,254 Accounts Receivable, net.  Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2020 and 2019 was not material. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of estimated product returns which are not material.Concentration of Credit Risk.  Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.  Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount, and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of accounts receivable as of October 31, 2020, or 2019.64AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Inventory.  Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.Property, Plant and Equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over 3 years to 10 years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.Capitalized Software.  We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over 3 years to 5 years once development is complete.Leases.  We determine whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to November 1, 2019, for leases where we are the lessee, we accounted for operating lease payments by charging them to expense as incurred. At the beginning of fiscal 2020, the company adopted new lease accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"").  The most significant change requires lessees to record the present value of operating lease payments as right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Where we are the lessee, ROU assets represent the company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or non-current is based on the expected timing of payments due under our obligations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. In order to determine the appropriate incremental borrowing rates, we have used a number of factors including the company's credit rating, the lease term and the currency swap rate. The ROU asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for operating leases with an initial term of more than twelve months is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. We have lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-lease components. We have elected to account for these payments as a single lease component.A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements where Agilent is the lessor. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") Topic 606, Revenue Contracts with Customers, and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the  revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas  the revenue associated with the consumables, the  non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard.   See also Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" and Note 10, ""Leases"" for additional information about the company’s leases. Acquisitions.  Agilent accounts for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, and we allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life.Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and IPR&D acquired 65AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)involve significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.  Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2020, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2020, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2020. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. During the year ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. 66AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During the year ended October 31, 2020 we recorded an impairment charge of long-lived assets including indefinite-lived in-process research and development of $98 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. During fiscal year 2019, there were no impairments of other assets or intangible assets. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable. Variable Interest Entities.  We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).  The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We have determined that as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no VIE's required to be consolidated in the company's consolidated financial statements because we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the VIE's in which we have invested nor are we the primary beneficiary. We account for these investments under either the equity method or as equity investments without readily determinable fair value, depending on the circumstances. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure.  During the year ended October 31, 2018, we exercised our option and acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen, Inc. (""Lasergen"") that we did not already own for an additional cash consideration of approximately $107 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income. Lasergen was previously considered a VIE.  As of October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019, the total carrying value of investments and loans in privately held companies considered as VIEs was $67 million and $29 million respectively. The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value because we do not have future funding commitments. The investments are included on the long-term investments line and the loans on the other current assets and other assets lines (depending upon tenure of loan) on the consolidated balance sheet.Investments.  Equity investments without readily determinable fair value consist of non-marketable equity securities (typically investments in privately-held companies). These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost, and we adjust for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) included in net income as and when it occurs. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Prior to fiscal year 2019, both equity investments without determinable fair value and with determinable fair value were accounted for using cost method of accounting, measured at historical cost less other-than-temporary investment. Trading securities, which are comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, other investments and deferred compensation liabilities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of October 31, 2020 and 2019. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments which are readily determinable, and which are not accounted under the equity method are reported at fair value using quoted market prices for those securities when available with gains and losses included in net income. The fair value of long-term equity investments which are not readily determinable, and which are not accounted under the equity method are reported at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments included in net income. The fair value of our senior notes, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy exceeds the carrying value by approximately $162 million as of October 31, 2020 and approximately $62 million as of October 31, 2019. The change in the fair value over carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2020 is primarily due to decreased market interest rates.  The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are 67AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 13, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.Warranty.  Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost over the period. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 16, ""Guarantees"".Employee Compensation and Benefits.  Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $111 million and $115 million as of October 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans.  Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans.  Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.   Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually.   See Note 15, “Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans” for additional information.Retirement of Treasury Shares.  Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital, based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings.  All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares.Share-Based Compensation.  For the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program (""LTPP"") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting.  Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $84 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $71 million in 2018. See Note 5, ""Share-based Compensation"" for additional information.Derivative Instruments.  Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options, interest rate swaps and interest rate locks to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies. Foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months, interest rate swaps mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt and interest rate locks mature at the same time as the issuance of debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. The impact of the ineffectiveness measurement in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was not material. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.68AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Foreign Currency Translation.  We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and were $4 million loss for 2020, $7 million loss for 2019 and $3 million loss for 2018. 2.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on the balance sheet as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, with a corresponding right-of-use asset. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the prior accounting standard. On November 1, 2019, we adopted the new accounting guidance using the modified retrospective method, by applying the transition approach, for all lease arrangements at the beginning of the period of adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning November 1, 2019 are presented under the new accounting standard, while prior period amounts have not been restated. The standard had a significant impact on the opening consolidated balance sheet as of November 1, 2019, but did not have a significant impact on the consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended October 31, 2020 when compared to prior periods. The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while the accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. For leases that commenced before the effective date of the new accounting standard, we elected the permitted practical expedients to not reassess the following: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. We also elected to exclude leases with a term of 12 months or less in the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Adoption of the new guidance impacted the consolidated balance sheet as follows: October 31, 2019Impact of AdoptingNovember 1, 2019 As ReportedLease GuidanceAs Adopted(in millions)Other assets$611 $192 $803 Other accrued liabilities$440 $48 $488 Other long-term liabilities$473 $144 $617 On November 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective approach only to contracts not completed as of this date. Results for reporting periods after November 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to require a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. During 2018 and 2019, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2020. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.69AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amendment also simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement which eliminates certain disclosure requirements and modifies others. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020, and for interim periods within that year with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the effectiveness of disclosures for defined benefit plans under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 715-20. The amendments in this guidance remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This guidance eliminates certain exceptions to existing guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The guidance also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2021, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The guidance clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2021, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2020, the FASB issued an update for facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.  This update provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the guidance provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Inter-bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.  When elected, the optional expedients for contract modifications are applied consistently for all eligible contracts or eligible transactions within the relevant Topic or Industry Subtopic in the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may generally be applied through December 31, 2022 to any new or amended contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR. We are currently evaluating our contracts and we do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.     ACQUISITIONSAcquisition of BioTek and ACEAOn August 23, 2019 we completed the acquisition of privately-owned Lionheart Technologies LLC (""BioTek""), a leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of innovative life science instrumentation for $1.17 billion, under the merger agreement. As a result of the acquisition, BioTek became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Accordingly, the results of 70AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)BioTek are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. The acquisition of BioTek and its portfolio is another step to expand our position in the cell analysis market.The consideration paid was $1.17 billion.  Agilent funded the acquisition using existing cash of $470 million and debt of $700 million. The BioTek acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by Agilent at their estimated fair values. Agilent determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, and estimates made by management. We expect to realize revenue synergies, leverage and expand the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of BioTek’s net identifiable assets acquired (see summary of net assets below), and, as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. Goodwill acquired was allocated to our operating segments and reporting units as a part of the purchase price allocation. All goodwill was allocated to the life sciences and applied markets reporting unit. Agilent’s acquisition of BioTek is treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes.  The tax basis of the acquired assets equals the fair market value on acquisition date.The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date of August 23, 2019 (in millions):Cash and cash equivalents$10 Accounts receivable28 Inventories21 Other current assets2 Property, plant and equipment8 Intangible assets641 Goodwill483 Total assets acquired$1,193 Accounts payable(4)Deferred revenue(5)Employee compensation and benefits(7)Other accrued liabilities(2)Long-term debt(4)Net assets acquired$1,171 The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities were generally determined using historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair values for acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue were determined with the input from third party valuation specialists. The fair values of certain other assets, inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments, long-term debt, and certain other long-term liabilities were determined internally using historical carrying values and estimates made by management. 71AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Valuations of intangible assets acquired The components of intangible assets acquired in connection with the BioTek acquisition were as follows (in millions): Fair ValueEstimatedUseful LifeDeveloped product technology$387 5-13 yearsCustomer relationships202 3-8 yearsBacklog5 2 monthsTradenames and trademarks43 10 yearsTotal intangible assets subject to amortization$637 In-process research and development4  Total intangible assets$641  As noted above, the intangible assets, including in-process research and development, were valued with input from valuation specialists. Agilent used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the BioTek acquisition.  Specifically, the developed product technology and in-process research and development were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach by discounting forecasted cash flows directly related to the products expecting to result from the projects, net of returns on contributory assets.  The company utilized the incremental cash flow method for determining the fair value of the customer relationships acquired, and the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the tradename. Order backlog was valued on a direct cash flow basis. The primary in-process research and development project acquired relates to a next version of a product which was subsequently released to customers in 2020.  After release, the asset was moved to developed technology.Acquisition and integration costs directly related to the BioTek acquisition totaled $12 million and $4 million for the year ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were recorded in operating expenses and cost of sales. Such costs are expensed in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance.On November 14, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences (“ACEA”), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million. The financial results of ACEA have been included in our financial results from the acquisition date. The following represents the unaudited proforma operating results as if BioTek and ACEA had been included in the company's consolidated statements of operations as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 (in millions, except per share amounts): 20192018Net revenue$5,308 $5,112 Net income$1,012 $210 Net income per share — basic$3.22 $0.65 Net income per share — diluted$3.18 $0.65 The unaudited proforma financial information assumes that the companies were combined as of November 1, 2017 and include business combination accounting effects from the acquisition including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, the impact on cost of sales due to the respective estimated fair value adjustments to inventory, changes to interest income for cash used in the acquisition, interest expense associated with debt paid in connection with the acquisition and acquisition related transaction costs and tax related effects.

Instrumentation revenue includes sales from instruments, remarketed instruments and third-party products. Non-instrumentation and other revenue include sales from contract and per incident services, our companion diagnostics and our nucleic acid solutions businesses as well as sales from spare parts, consumables, reagents, vacuum pumps, subscriptions, software licenses and associated services.73AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Contract BalancesContract Assets Contract assets (unbilled accounts receivable) primarily relate to the company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The unbilled receivables are reclassified to trade receivables when billed to customers. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets and are included in ""Accounts receivable, net"" in the consolidated balance sheet. The balances of contract assets as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, were $153 million and $110 million, respectively. The increase in unbilled receivables during the year ended October 31, 2020 is a result of recognition of revenue upon the transfer of the control to the customer. Contract LiabilitiesThe following table provides information about contract liabilities (deferred revenue) and the significant changes in the balances during the years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020: Contract Liabilities(in millions)Ending balance as of October 31, 2018$367 Impact of adoption of new revenue recognition guidance(11)Net revenue deferred in the period303 Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period(287)Change in deferrals from customer cash advances, net of revenue recognized5 Contract liabilities acquired in business combinations9 Currency translation and other adjustments— Ending balance as of October 31, 2019$386 Net revenue deferred in the period347 Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period(300)Change in deferrals from customer cash advances, net of revenue recognized9 Currency translation and other adjustments4 Ending balance as of October 31,2020$446 Contract liabilities primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either current in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation.Contract CostsIncremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognized as an asset if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. The changes in total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 and are included in other current and long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We have applied the practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include the company's internal sales force compensation program, as we have determined that annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.74AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations   We have applied the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and have not disclosed information about transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. The estimated revenue expected to be recognized for remaining performance obligations that have an original term of more than one year, as of October 31, 2020, was $217 million, the majority of which is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligations primarily include extended warranty, customer manufacturing contracts, and software maintenance contracts and revenue associated with lease arrangements. 5.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including restricted stock units, stock options, employee stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the long-term performance plan (""LTPP"") based on estimated fair values. Description of Share-Based PlansEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.    Effective May 1, 2020, we adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") which replaced our previous Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. There are 31 million shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP.Under our ESPP, employees purchased 628,644 shares for $41 million in 2020, 603,488 shares for $37 million in 2019 and 558,116 shares for $32 million in 2018. As of October 31, 2020, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 25,770,573. This excludes the number of shares of common stock to be issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participant contributions totaling $22 million as of October 31, 2020.Incentive Compensation Plans. On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the ""2018 Plan"") which amends, including renaming and extending the term of, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the ""2009 Plan"").  The 2009 plan replaced the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (""SARs""), restricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2018 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2020, 25,596,430 shares were available for future awards under the 2018 Plan.Stock options under the 2018 Plan may be either ""incentive stock options"", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options were granted prior to November 1, 2015 and generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. Agilent issues new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program administered under the 2018 Plan, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period if specified performance targets over the three-year period are met. The performance target for grants made beginning in 2017 and thereafter were based on Earnings Per Share (""EPS""). The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period are set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.75AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Based on the performance metrics, the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met.We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Impact of Share-based Compensation AwardsWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows:Years Ended October 31,202020192018(in millions)Cost of products and services$21 $18 $16 Research and development9 7 7 Selling, general and administrative54 47 48 Total share-based compensation expense$84 $72 $71 At October 31, 2020 and 2019, no share-based compensation was capitalized within inventory. Valuation AssumptionsFor all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date.The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards and LTPP (EPS) was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and as appropriate, a discount related to the one-year post vesting. The compensation cost for LTPP (EPS) awards reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of awards granted. Years Ended October 31, 202020192018LTPP:   Volatility of Agilent shares23%22%21%Volatility of selected peer-company shares15%-44%15%-66%14%-66%Pair-wise correlation with selected peers29%30%32%Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards5.3%5.0%4.8%Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2017 and thereafter, we used our own historical stock price volatility.76AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)           All LTPP awards granted have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period instead of being required to hold the shares.

For the year ended October 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates.For 2019, the company's income tax benefit was $152 million with an effective tax rate of (16.5) percent. For the year ended October 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.As part of the business integration of some of our prior acquisitions, we undertook corporate restructurings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 that involved on-shoring certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States. These restructurings resulted in a cash tax liability of $231 million. These taxes generate tax attributes that will offset our transition tax liability which is included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  For 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) consisting of (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $71 million, $368 million, and $87 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.23, $1.16, and $0.27 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.79AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: Years Ended October 31, 20202019 (in millions)Deferred Tax AssetsIntangibles$153 $131 Pension benefits and retiree medical benefits65 71 Employee benefits, other than retirement31 34 Net operating loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards182 195 Share-based compensation27 32 Deferred revenue22 38 Lease obligations35 — Other41 35 Deferred tax assets$556 $536 Tax valuation allowance(132)(134)Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance$424 $402 Deferred Tax LiabilitiesProperty, plant and equipment$(19)$(16)Right-of-use asset(35)— Other(14)(7)Deferred tax liabilities$(68)$(23)Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)$356 $379 Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2020, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $132 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred tax assets for the states of California and Colorado, along with the net operating losses in the Netherlands and capital losses in the U.S. and Australia.At October 31, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $11 million, $530 million and $411 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021. If not utilized, $123 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021. The remaining $288 million of the foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2020, we had federal and foreign capital loss carryforwards of $48 million and $118 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2022. The foreign capital losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2020, we had state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $83 million. The state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.

However, approximately $25 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions that, if recognized, would be in the form of a deferred tax asset that would likely not affect our effective tax rate due to a valuation allowance.We recognized tax expense of $8 million,  $9 million and $11 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2020 and 2019 were $45 million and $36 million, respectively.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2017 for federal income tax purposes and for significant states. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2009. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.81AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)7.     NET INCOME PER SHAREThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below.  Years Ended October 31, 202020192018 (in millions)Numerator:   Net income$719 $1,071 $316 Denominators:   Basic weighted average shares309 314 321 Potential common shares — stock options and other employee stock plans3 4 4 Diluted weighted average shares312 318 325 The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued share-based awards of approximately 2 million each year.  For the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, the impacts of the anti-dilutive potential common shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share were not material.8.     INVENTORYInventory as of October 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following: October 31, 20202019 (in millions)Finished goods$417 $416 Purchased parts and fabricated assemblies303 263 Inventory$720 $679 Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges of $28 million were recorded in cost of products in 2020, $19 million in 2019 and $26 million in 2018.

In 2020 and 2019 we retired approximately $29 million and $23 million, respectively, of fully depreciated assets that were no longer in use.10.     LEASESAs a lessee, we have various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for office space, warehouses, distribution centers, research and development facilities, manufacturing and production locations as well as vehicles, personal computers and other equipment. Our real estate leases have remaining lease terms of one to thirty years, which represent the non-cancelable periods of the leases and include extension options that we determined are reasonably certain to be exercised. We exclude options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised from our lease terms, ranging from six months to twenty years. Our lease payments consist primarily of fixed rental payments for the right to use the underlying leased assets over the lease terms. We often receive incentives from our landlords, such as rent abatement periods, which effectively reduce the total lease payments owed for these leases. Vehicle, personal computer and other equipment operating leases have terms between three and five years. Prior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, future minimum lease payments as of October 31, 2019 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding twelve months were as follows:Operating Leases(in millions)2020$52 2021$41 2022$29 2023$21 2024$14 Thereafter$56 The components of lease cost for operating leases were as follows:Year Ended October 31, 2020(in millions)Operating lease cost$60 Short-term lease cost1 Variable lease cost (a)14 Sublease income(14)Total lease cost$61 (a)  Variable lease cost includes cancelable leases, non-fixed maintenance costs and non-recoverable transaction taxes.

Equipment lease revenue for operating lease agreements is recognized as visualization kits and reagents are shipped over the life of the lease, and the cost of customer leased equipment is recorded within property, plant and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet and depreciated over the equipment’s estimated useful life. For an arrangement that has been classified as a sales-type lease, revenue is recognized when the transfer of control of the underlying leased asset has occurred and the net investment lease recorded which is calculated at the present value of the remaining lease payments due from the lessee.   84AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Revenue allocated to the lease income for both finance/sales-type lease and operating lease rental arrangements represents less than one percent of total net revenue in the year ended October 31, 2020.  As of October 31, 2020, the original cost and net book value of operating leased assets was $43 million and $12 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2020, lease receivables related to sales-type leases were $44 million.  As of October 31, 2019, the original cost and net book value of operating leased assets was $49 million and $17 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2019, lease receivables related to sales-type leases were $37 million.11.   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe following table presents goodwill balances and the movements for each of our reportable segments during the years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020:Life Sciences and Applied MarketsDiagnostics and GenomicsAgilent CrossLabTotal (in millions)Goodwill as of October 31, 2018$803 $1,607 $563 $2,973 Foreign currency translation impact(1)(2)(2)(5)Goodwill arising from acquisitions636 (11)— 625 Goodwill as of October 31, 2019$1,438 $1,594 $561 $3,593 Foreign currency translation impact3 5 1 9 Goodwill as of October 31, 2020$1,441 $1,599 $562 $3,602 As of September 30, 2020, our annual impairment test date, we assessed goodwill for triggering events and circumstances, including impacts due to COVID-19, and determined no impairment of goodwill was indicated for our reporting units.The component parts of other intangible assets at October 31, 2019 and 2020 are shown in the table below: Other Intangible Assets GrossCarryingAmountAccumulatedAmortizationNet BookValue (in millions)As of October 31, 2019:   Purchased technology$1,413 $763 $650 Backlog5 5 — Trademark/Tradename196 102 94 Customer relationships329 87 242 Third-party technology and licenses28 22 6 Total amortizable intangible assets$1,971 $979 $992 In-Process R&D115 — 115 Total$2,086 $979 $1,107 As of October 31, 2020:   Purchased technology$1,429 $863 $566 Trademark/Tradename196 117 79 Customer relationships330 158 172 Third-party technology and licenses11 7 4 Total amortizable intangible assets$1,966 $1,145 $821 In-Process R&D10 — 10 Total$1,976 $1,145 $831 During fiscal year 2020, we recorded no additions to goodwill or to intangible assets. During the year ended October 31, 2020 we moved $15 million of in-process research and development intangible assets to purchased technology on the completion of three projects.85AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)During fiscal year 2019, we recorded additions to goodwill of $636 million and to other intangible assets of $744 million related to the acquisition of ACEA Biosciences and BioTek. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded a measurement period adjustment to goodwill of $11 million for deferred tax assets related to pre-acquisition net operating losses of Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. The increase to other intangible assets due to foreign currency translation was not material in 2019. In general, for United States federal tax purposes, goodwill from asset purchases is amortizable; however, any goodwill created as part of a stock acquisition is not deductible.During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million in research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations which was related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. There were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal year 2019 and 2018. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments of finite-lived intangible assets recorded. During 2018, we recorded an impairment of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable. During 2020, we also wrote-off the gross carrying amount of $17 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets which were no longer being used. Amortization expense of intangible assets was $186 million in 2020, $128 million in 2019, and $110 million in 2018. Future amortization expense related to existing finite-lived purchased intangible assets associated with business combinations for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is estimated below:Estimated future amortization expense:(in millions)2021$174 2022$151 2023$109 2024$87 2025$70 Thereafter$230 12.   INVESTMENTSThe following table summarizes the company's equity investments as of October 31, 2020 and 2019 (net book value): October 31, 20202019 (in millions)Long-Term  Equity investments - without readily determinable fair value$103 $47 Equity investments - with readily determinable fair value25 25 Trading securities30 30 Total$158 $102 Equity investments without readily determinable fair value (RDFV) consist of non-marketable equity securities issued by private companies. These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost adjusting for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer). The adjustments are included in net income in the period in which they occur. Equity investments with RDFV consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Prior to fiscal year 2019, both equity investments without RDFV and with RDFV were accounted for using cost method of accounting, measured at historical cost less other-than-temporary impairment. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.86AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Our investments without RDFV are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment.We recorded a net unrealized loss on our equity securities with RDFV of $1 million in 2020 and a net unrealized gain of  $3 million in 2019. Net unrealized gains on our equity securities without RDFV were $27 million and $1 million  in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Upon adoption of new accounting guidance relating to financial instruments beginning fiscal year 2019, the gains and losses on such securities are recognized in other income (expense) and therefore not applicable in prior periods. As of November 1, 2019, total impact of adoption of this accounting guidance to our consolidated balance sheet was an increase of $7 million to equity securities with RDFV (included within long-term investments) and a net increase of $5 million to beginning retained earnings.Net unrealized gains on our trading securities portfolio were $2 million in 2020, $3 million in 2019 and $1 million in 2018.13.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.Fair Value HierarchyThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.87AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2020 were as follows:  Fair Value Measurement at October 31, 2020 Using October 31,2020Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1)SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:    Short-term    Cash equivalents (money market funds)$740 $740 $— $— Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)2 — 2 — Long-term    Trading securities30 30 — — Other investments25 — 25 — Total assets measured at fair value$797 $770 $27 $— Liabilities:    Short-term    Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$17 $— $17 $— Long-term    Deferred compensation liability30 — 30 — Total liabilities measured at fair value$47 $— $47 $— Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2019 were as follows:  Fair Value Measurement at October 31, 2019 Using October 31,2019Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1)SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:    Short-term    Cash equivalents (money market funds)$784 $784 $— $— Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)12 — 12 — Long-term    Trading securities30 30 — — Other investments25 — 25 — Total assets measured at fair value$851 $814 $37 $— Liabilities:   Short-term    Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$6 $— $6 $— Long-term    Deferred compensation liability30 — 30 — Total liabilities measured at fair value$36 $— $36 $— Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because, although the values are not directly based on 88AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable. Other investments represent shares we own in a special fund that targets underlying investments of approximately 40 percent in debt securities and 60 percent in equity securities. It has been classified as level 2 because, although the shares of the fund are not traded on any active stock exchange, each of the individual underlying securities are or can be derived from and hence we have a readily determinable value for the underlying securities, from which we are able to determine the fair market value for the special fund itself.Trading securities, which are comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, other investments and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisLong-Lived AssetsFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Years EndedOctober 31, 202020192018 (in millions)Long-lived assets held and used$98 $— $21 Long-lived assets held for sale$— $— $— For the year ended October 31, 2020, long-lived assets held and used, including indefinite lived in-process research and development intangible assets, with a carrying amount of $98 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $98 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program and other assets in our diagnostics and genomics segment. There were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used in 2019. For 2018, long lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $21 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $21 million, which relates to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable and were included in net income.  There were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2020, 2019 and 2018.Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets during 2020 and 2018 were measured using level 3 inputs. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets in 2020 and 2018, we used the income approach based on projected discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets over the remaining useful life.For the year ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no impairments in non-marketable securities without readily determinable fair value. For the year ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, a net unrealized gain of $27 million and $1 million, respectively, was included in net income as an adjustment to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair value based on an observable market transaction. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values was $103 million and $47 million, respectively.Fair values for the non-marketable securities included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet were measured using Level 3 inputs because they are primarily equity stock issued by private companies without quoted market prices. To estimate the fair value of our non-marketable securities, we use the measurement alternative to record these investments at cost and adjust for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) as and when they occur.89AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)14.   DERIVATIVESWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts and purchased options to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. For open contracts as of October 31, 2020, changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in cost of sales over the life of the foreign exchange contract. The changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to other income (expense), net in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in cost of sales over the life of the option contract.  For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, ineffectiveness and gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 13, 2012.  We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012, and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2020 was less than $1 million. In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2020 was $6 million. In August 2019, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $250 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2029 senior notes issued on September 16, 2019. We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 6, 2019 and we recognized a deferred loss of $6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2029 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2020 was $5 million. Net Investment HedgesStarting in 2020, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and are designated and qualify as net investment hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. Changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. If the company’s net investment changes during the year, the hedge relationship will be assessed and de-designated if the hedge notional amount is outside of prescribed tolerance with a gain/loss reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) in the current period.As of October 31, 2020, we have 3 open forward contracts to sell euros to buy USD maturing in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, and these are designated as a net investment hedge of the U.S. parent's interest in foreign subsidiaries denominated in euro functional currency. In the year ended October 31, 2020, the change in fair value of the net investment hedge resulted in 90AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)a net loss of $5 million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the year ended October 31, 2020, ineffectiveness and the resultant effect of any gains or losses recognized in other income (expense) due to de-designation of the hedge contracts were not significant.Other HedgesAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2020, was $16 million. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2020.There were 270 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2020 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 183 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2020 not designated as hedging instruments.

Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.Agilent provides defined benefits to U.S. employees who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the ""RP""). For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the ""DPSP""), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $123 million and $132 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.Effective November 1, 2014, Agilent’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan was closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires.  As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen. Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there are no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016.Agilent also maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""SBRP"") in the U.S., which is a supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the ""U.S. Plans"" in the tables below.Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements.Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Plans.  In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. –Eligible retirees who were less than age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for a fixed amount which can be utilized to pay for either sponsored plans and/or individual Medicare plans. –Effective January 1, 2012, employees who were at least age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for fixed dollar subsidies and stipends. Grandfathered retirees receive a fixed monthly subsidy toward pre-65 premium costs (subsidy capped at 2011 levels) and a fixed monthly stipend post-65. The subsidy amounts will not increase. –Any new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the retiree medical plans upon retiring.  –As of April 30, 2016, benefits under this plan were changed for Active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service, as of April 30, 2016 - for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan. These employees will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement.401(k) Defined Contribution Plan.  Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan. We match contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation.  Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $41 million in 2020, $39 million in 2019 and $37 million in 2018.93AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Components of Net periodic cost.  The service cost component is recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. All other cost components are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of:   PensionsU.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. PlansNon-U.S. Plans 202020192018202020192018202020192018 (in millions)Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)         Service cost — benefits earned during the period$— $— $— $24 $20 $20 $1 $— $1 Interest cost on benefit obligation15 18 16 8 14 13 3 4 3 Expected return on plan assets(28)(27)(28)(47)(43)(46)(7)(7)(7)Amortization of net actuarial loss3 1 1 49 34 29 4 4 8 Amortization of prior service benefit— — — — — — (7)(8)(8)Total periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(10)$(8)$(11)$34 $25 $16 $(6)$(7)$(3)Settlement (gain) loss$4 $— $— $— $— $(5)$— $— $— Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss         Net actuarial (gain) loss$26 $51 $2 $20 $104 $49 $5 $5 $(2)Amortization of net actuarial loss(3)(1)(1)(49)(34)(29)(4)(4)(8)Amortization of prior service benefit— — — — — — 7 8 8 Loss due to settlement(4)— — — — — — — — Foreign currency— — — 10 (3)1 — — — Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss$19 $50 $1 $(19)$67 $21 $8 $9 $(2)Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss$13 $42 $(10)$15 $92 $32 $2 $2 $(5) 94AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Funded Status.    As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. DefinedBenefit PlansNon-U.S. DefinedBenefit PlansU.S.Post-RetirementBenefit Plans 202020192020201920202019 (in millions)Change in fair value of plan assets:      Fair value — beginning of year$432 $401 $911 $825 $95 $90 Actual return on plan assets30 50 (2)85 6 11 Employer contributions— — 32 21 — — Participants' contributions— — 1 1 — — Benefits paid(8)(19)(31)(29)(8)(6)Settlements(15)— — — — — Currency impact— — 34 8 — — Fair value — end of year$439 $432 $945 $911 $93 $95 Change in benefit obligation:      Benefit obligation — beginning of year$491 $420 $1,067 $913 $94 $87 Service cost— — 24 20 1 — Interest cost15 18 8 14 3 4 Participants' contributions— — 1 1 — — Actuarial (gain) loss28 74 (19)143 4 9 Benefits paid(9)(21)(31)(29)(8)(6)Settlements(15)— — — — — Currency impact— — 44 5 — — Benefit obligation — end of year$510 $491 $1,094 $1,067 $94 $94 Overfunded (underfunded) status of PBO$(71)$(59)$(149)$(156)$(1)$1 Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:      Other assets$— $— $123 $106 $— $1 Employee compensation and benefits(1)(1)— — — — Retirement and post-retirement benefits(70)(58)(272)(262)(1)— Total net asset (liability)$(71)$(59)$(149)$(156)$(1)$1 Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):Actuarial (gains) losses$134 $115 $311 $330 $11 $10 Prior service costs (benefits)— — — — (5)(12)Total$134 $115 $311 $330 $6 $(2)The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) expected to be recognized by Agilent as components of net expense during 2021 are as follows:U.S. DefinedBenefit PlansNon-U.S. DefinedBenefit PlansU.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit)$— $— $(1)Amortization of actuarial net loss$4 $52 $4 95AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Investment Policies and Strategies as of October 31, 2020 and 2019. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consist of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 24 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 38 percent to 65 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2020 and 2019 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as the practical expedient. In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund.Fair Value. The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 13, ""Fair Value Measurements"".Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments.Equity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock that are not traded on an active market are valued at quoted prices reported by investment dealers based on the underlying terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Other Investments - Other investments also include partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3.Agilent has adopted the accounting guidance related to the presentation of certain investments using the NAV practical expedient. The accounting guidance exempts investments using this practical expedient from categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 96AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2020 and 2019, were determined based on the results of 100AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds.

The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost over the period. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend to one year from the date of delivery, depending on the product.101AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below.  October 31, 20202019 (in millions)Standard warranty accrual, beginning balance$32 $35 Accruals for warranties including change in estimates49 54 Settlements made during the period(49)(57)Standard warranty accrual, ending balance$32 $32 Accruals for warranties due within one year$30 $32 Accruals for warranties due after one year2 — Standard warranty accrual, ending balance$32 $32 Bank GuaranteesGuarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and were approximately $43 million and $40 million as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A standby letter of credit is a guarantee of payment issued by a bank on behalf of us that is used as payment of last resort should we fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party. A bank guarantee is a promise from a bank or other lending institution that if we default on a loan, the bank will cover the loss. Indemnifications in Connection with TransactionsIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2020.  Indemnifications to Officers and DirectorsOur corporate bylaws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the bylaws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our bylaws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2020.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to 102AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2020.In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2020.17.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOther Purchase Commitments.  Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under ""other purchase commitments"" were approximately $85 million. Approximately $23 million of the penalties for the new contracts will reduce over the next 13 years.Contingencies:  We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, commercial, real estate, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.18.   SHORT-TERM DEBTCredit FacilitiesOn March 13, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024. For the year ended October 31, 2020, we borrowed $798 million and repaid $913 million under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2020, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.   On August 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provides for a $500 million short-term loan facility that was used in full to complete the BioTek acquisition and which was repaid in full as of October 31, 2020. On October 21, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement, which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to $500 million. We had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of October 31, 2020. On April 17, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to the credit agreement which provides the company with the option to request the consent of the applicable class of lenders to extend the maturity date of revolving borrowings and swingline loans for an additional period of one year and of the 2019 incremental term loans for an additional period of up to 364 days. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the year ended October 31, 2020.Commercial PaperIn May 2020, we established a U.S. commercial paper program, under which the company may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.0 billion with up to 397-day maturities.  At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2020, borrowings outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.17 percent and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately five days. We had borrowings of $75 million outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program as of October 31, 2020.2020 Senior NotesOn July 13, 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2020 senior notes""). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes were scheduled to mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was 103AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)approximately $34 million. The gain was deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.On September 17, 2019, we repaid the $500 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2020 senior notes due July 15, 2020 that were called for redemption on August 16, 2019. The redemption price of approximately $512 million included a $12 million prepayment penalty. The redemption price was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2020 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest related to the redemption.  The prepayment penalty plus amortization of the previously deferred interest swap gain of $4 million and amortization of previously deferred debt issuance costs and discount of $1 million were recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. We also paid accrued and unpaid interest of $4 million on the 2020 senior notes up to but not including the redemption date. 19.   LONG-TERM DEBTSenior NotesThe following table summarizes the company's long-term senior notes: October 31, 2020October 31, 2019 AmortizedPrincipalAmortizedPrincipal (in millions)2022 Senior Notes$400 $399 2023 Senior Notes598 597 2026 Senior Notes298 298 2029 Senior Notes493 492 2030 Senior Notes495 — Total$2,284 $1,786 2022 Senior NotesOn September 13, 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes (""2022 senior notes"").

We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (""MP-AES"") instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (""ICP-OES"") instruments; raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer; cell imaging systems; microplate reader; laboratory software for sample tracking; information 108AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients (""APIs"") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (""NGS"") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. This business also includes solutions that enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (""GMP"") conditions for use as API in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Third, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings for cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (""IHC""), in situ hybridization (""ISH""), hematoxylin and eosin (""H&E"") staining and special staining. Fourth, we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Fifth, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. Finally, our biomolecular analysis business provides complete workflow solutions, including instruments, consumables and software, for quality control analysis of nucleic acid samples.  Samples are analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure accuracy in further genomics analysis techniques utilized in clinical and life science research applications. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.  Most of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices.  Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab. Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies. Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity. Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements.A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, tax, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, order administration, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, pension curtailment or settlement gains, restructuring and transformational initiatives expenses, acquisition and integration costs, business exit and divestiture costs, special compliance costs, some nucleic acid solutions division (""NASD"") site costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, in-sourcing or outsourcing of activities.The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.109AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding items such as asset impairment charges, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations, interest income, interest expense, and other items as noted in the reconciliations below.Life Sciences and Applied MarketsDiagnostics and GenomicsAgilent CrossLabTotalSegments (in millions)Year Ended October 31, 2020:    Total net revenue$2,392 $1,047 $1,900 $5,339 Income from operations$548 $192 $516 $1,256 Depreciation expense$43 $39 $37 $119 Share-based compensation expense (1)$35 $17 $29 $81 Year Ended October 31, 2019:   Total net revenue$2,302 $1,021 $1,840 $5,163 Income from operations$542 $185 $475 $1,202 Depreciation expense$41 $35 $35 $111 Share-based compensation expense$33 $14 $25 $72 Year Ended October 31, 2018:   Total net revenue$2,270 $943 $1,701 $4,914 Income from operations$543 $173 $388 $1,104 Depreciation expense$38 $33 $31 $102 Share-based compensation expense$33 $14 $24 $71 (1) Share-based compensation expense in 2020 excludes amounts not allocated to the segments related to accelerated share-based compensation expense from workforce reduction and from our acquisition of BioTek.The following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 202020192018 (in millions)Total reportable segments' income from operations$1,256 $1,202 $1,104 Amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations(184)(125)(105)Acquisition and integration costs(41)(48)(23)Transformational initiatives(53)(44)(25)Acceleration of share-based compensation expense related to workforce reduction(2)— — Asset impairments(99)— (21)Business exit and divestiture costs (2)— (9)NASD site costs— (12)(8)Special compliance costs— (2)(4)Other (1) (29)(30)(5)Interest Income8 36 38 Interest Expense(78)(74)(75)Other income (expense), net (2)66 16 79 Income before taxes, as reported$842 $919 $946 (1)  For the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, the other category primarily includes legal costs related to a claim we pursued against Twist Bioscience Corporation in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.(2)  For the year ended October 31, 2020, other income (expense), net includes the settlement of a legal claim against Twist Bioscience Corporation. 110AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Major Customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2020, 2019 or 2018.The following table reflects segment assets and capital expenditures under our management reporting system.

Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2019, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,600 people worldwide.Agilent Order Fulfillment OrganizationsOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (“OFS”) focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.        The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.Research and DevelopmentWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.12Table of Contents            BacklogWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.Materials Our life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.EnvironmentalOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws.We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.13Table of Contents            Information about our Executive Officers The names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:Henrik Ancher-Jensen, 54, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.  From September 2012 to September 2013, Mr. Ancher-Jensen served as our Vice President, Global Product Supply, Diagnostics and Genomics Group.  From September 2010 to September 2012 he served as Corporate Vice President, Global Operations of Dako A/S, a Danish diagnostics company, and as Dako’s Vice President, Supply Chain and Chief Information Officer from 2006 to September 2010.  Prior to joining Dako, he spent more than 15 years in senior management roles and management consulting with Chr.

Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.15Table of Contents            If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;•innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;•appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;•manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;•price our products competitively;•anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and•control product quality in our manufacturing process.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures. General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:•reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;•increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increased price pressure for our products and services; and•greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.16Table of Contents            Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.   Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have decreased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;•changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;•changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;•tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;•negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•differing protection of intellectual property;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and•geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries.  Tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Most of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, 17Table of Contents            operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that 18Table of Contents            we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.19Table of Contents            We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent. For example, the EU has adopted the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers will have until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR requirements for in vitro diagnostic medical devices currently on the market. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by 20Table of Contents            companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins, and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. 21Table of Contents            Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.   Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which 22Table of Contents            could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (""the Tax Act"") significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations.  Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.  The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), as well as state tax authorities.  The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.We are party to a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024.  As of October 31, 2019, the company had $115 million outstanding under the credit facility. On August 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provides for a $500 million short-term loan facility that was used in full to complete the acquisition of BioTek. On October 21, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement, which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to $500 million. We had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of October 31, 2019. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in senior unsecured notes. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stockOur incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:•increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.23Table of Contents            Our credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.As of October 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,382 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.24Table of Contents            Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.We are subject to the rules of the SEC which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.",>Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.,">Item 2.

The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. As of October 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1.03 billion of our common stock under this program.

(""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.In 2019, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences Inc. (""ACEA""), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million.  In addition, we completed the acquisition of privately-owned Lionheart Technologies LLC (""BioTek""), a leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of innovative life science instrumentation for $1.17 billion. The financial results of these businesses have been included in our financial results from the date of the close. In 2018, we acquired seven businesses for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million. The largest of which was Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc.

Net income was $1,071 million in 2019 compared to net income of $316 million and $684 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2019 was impacted by a discrete tax benefit of $299 million related to 30Table of Contents            restructuring and the extension of the company's tax incentive in Singapore. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2018 was impacted by a discrete tax charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act that was passed on December 22, 2017.  As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,382 million and $2,247 million, respectively.   On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased and retired approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired approximately 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $1.03 billion of our common stock under this program. During the year ended October 31, 2019, cash dividends of 0.656 per share, or $206 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2018, cash dividends of 0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2017, cash dividends of 0.528 per share, or $170 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 20, 2019 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock, or approximately $56 million which will be paid on January 22, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2019. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Looking forward, we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions, improving our customers' experience, continued growth and earnings expansion. We remain optimistic that we have the ability and resilience to manage any changing market conditions to deliver positive results in fiscal year 2020.   In addition, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue for 2020 but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.Revenue Recognition.    On November 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""ASC 606""). We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under ASC 606. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation 31Table of Contents            is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.  Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.A portion of our revenue relate to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance.Inventory Valuation.    We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions.    Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary 32Table of Contents            increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2019 and 2018, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2019, discount rates for the U.S. plans decreased compared to the previous year. For 2019 and 2018, the discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2019, decreased compared to the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in U.S. pension expense and $13 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 3 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 31 to 60 percent to equities, from 38 to 61 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2019 and 2018 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on U.S. pension expense and $9 million on non-U.S. pension expense. For 2019, actual return on assets was above expectations which, along with contributions during the year, decreased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in an increase of the funded status at year end. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $10 million expense in 2019, $3 million benefit in 2018 and $15 million expense in 2017. The years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 included a gain on curtailment and settlements of $5 million and $32 million, respectively.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2019, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill 33Table of Contents            impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2019. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") acquired involve significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2019. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.  We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis.  If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.34Table of Contents            The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. The Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. There were no substantial changes from our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to the transition tax expenses amount. The company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. Any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined. We have completed our analysis and elected to treat global intangible low-tax income (""GILTI"") as “current period cost”.  See Note 6, ""Income Taxes"" for more details.Adoption of New PronouncementsSee Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements,"" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.Foreign CurrencyOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2018. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. 35Table of Contents            Results from OperationsNet Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2019 over 2018 Change 2018 over 2017    Change 2019 2018 2017  (in millions)    Net revenue:         Products$3,877 $3,746 $3,397 3% 10%Services and other$1,286 $1,168 $1,075 10% 9%Total net revenue$5,163 $4,914 $4,472 5% 10%  Years Ended October 31, 2019 over 2018 Change 2018 over 2017    Change 2019 2018 2017 % of total net revenue:         Products75% 76% 76% (1) ppt —Services and other25% 24% 24% 1 ppt —Total100% 100% 100%    Agilent's net revenue of $5,163 million for the year ended October 31, 2019 increased 5 percent when compared to 2018.

Income Taxes Years Ended October 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$(152) $630 $119For 2019, the company's income tax benefit was $152 million with an effective tax rate of (16.5) percent. For the year ended October 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.For 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act as discussed below.For 2017, the company’s income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. Other tax holidays are due for renewal in 2020. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $368 million, $87 million, and $93 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $1.16, $0.27, and $0.29 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the Singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2019 in response to Singapore tax law changes. Of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the Singapore restructuring.38Table of Contents            2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.The Tax Act also established new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (""FDII""); (6) repealing domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (""SAB 118"") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. For the year ended October 31, 2018, the company recognized  income tax expense related to the Tax Act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate as described below. Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (""Transition Tax""): The Transition Tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P"") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-U.S. taxes paid (Tax Pools) on such earnings. Historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 E&P outside the U.S. For the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. Since the Tax Act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition U.S. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. The resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the Tax Act. We have completed our accounting for charges related to the Transition Tax.Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate:  The reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. The amount recorded for the year ended October31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. We have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes.GILTI:  The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI.  U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”).  We have completed our analysis and elected to treat GILTI as a “current period cost”.Indefinite Reinvestment Assertion: Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. The company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $10 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2016 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2015 for significant states. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2009. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income 39Table of Contents            taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.Segment OverviewThrough October 31, 2019, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. In 2019, we adopted new guidance related to the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. See Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" for more information.

Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur financial position as of October 31, 2019 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1,382 million as compared to $2,247 million as of October 31, 2018.As of October 31, 2019, approximately $1,310 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries and can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. We utilize a variety of funding strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.As a result of the Tax Act, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. federal income tax. This is offset by tax attributes that results in a net tax payable of $200 million.  The first installment of $36 million was paid in the second quarter of 2019 and the remaining will be paid over the next seven years. As part of the 45Table of Contents            business integration of some of our prior acquisitions, we undertook corporate restructurings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 that involved on-shoring certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States.  These restructurings resulted in a cash tax liability of $231 million which is payable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,021 million in 2019 as compared to $1,087 million provided in 2018 and $889 million provided in 2017.

For the year ended October 31, 2019, the net change of zero in tax-related assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act compared to $552 million in the same period of 2018, which primarily consisted of an estimated provision of $499 million of U.S. transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as well as an estimated $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate income tax rate. For the years ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, other assets and liabilities used cash of $43 million, $4 million and $98 million, respectively. The increase in cash usage for the year ended October 31, 2019 and October 31, 2017 in other assets and liabilities is primarily due to taxes.In 2019, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $106 million, $65 million in 2018, and $81 million in 2017. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 61 days in 2019, 54 days in 2018 and 55 days in 2017.

Total contributions in 2019 were $21 million or equal to total contribution in 2018.  Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2020.  We expect to contribute $24 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2020.        Net Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities in 2019 was $1,590 million and in 2018 was $705 million as compared to net cash used of $304 million in 2017.

See Note 16, ""Commitments and Contingencies"", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.48Table of Contents            Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2019 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsOperating leases$52 $70 $35 $56Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers481 12 — —Other purchase commitments77 — — —Retirement plans24 — — —Transitional pension contributions to our U.S. 401(k) plan$6 $3 $— $—Total$640 $85 $35 $56Operating Leases.    Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see Note 16, ""Commitments and Contingencies"".Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.    We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.In addition to the above-mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, in the past we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than $1 million. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other Purchase Commitments.    We have categorized ""other purchase commitments"" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under ""other purchase commitments"" were approximately $77 million within the next year. Approximately $25 million of the contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 14 years.Retirement Plans.    Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2019 or October 31, 2018.49Table of Contents            On Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2019 balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsSenior notes$— $400 $600 $800Credit facility115 — — —Short term loan500 — — —Interest expense59 118 69 87Transition tax35 — 39 90Capital leases1 1 1 3Total$710 $519 $709 $980Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018 include $328 million and $607 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities.  Of these amounts, $199 million and $215 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.  The remaining $129 million in other long-term liabilities relates to the one-time transition tax payable. 50Table of Contents            ",">Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 51 percent of our revenue in 2019, 53 percent of our revenue in 2018 and 51 percent of our revenues in 2017 were generated in U.S. dollars. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2019. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.  We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.51Table of Contents            ",">Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements Page   Consolidated Financial Statements:  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 53Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019 56Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019 57Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2019 and 2018 58Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019 59Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019 60Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 61Quarterly Summary (unaudited) 11352Table of Contents            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Agilent Technologies, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting PrincipleAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2019.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded ACEA Biosciences (“ACEA”) and Lionheart Technologies LLC (“BioTek”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2019 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2019. We have also excluded ACEA and BioTek from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. ACEA and BioTek are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 2% and less than 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended October 31, 2019.53Table of Contents            Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $227 million as of October 31, 2019. As disclosed by management, the estimate of the Company’s tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions requires management to assess uncertainties and to make judgments about the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various other foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examinations of its tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. The Company has a number of years and matters which remain subject to examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions that could result in significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable.  The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when determining uncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the numerous and complex tax laws, tax audits, and potential for significant adjustments as a result of such audits. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate the timely identification and accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions is complex and required significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often highly subjective, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained.  Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liability for uncertain tax positions, and controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the liability. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of information used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including intercompany agreements, international, federal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax returns, testing the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions by jurisdiction, including management’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained, testing the completeness of management’s assessment of both the identification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes of each uncertain tax position, and evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions related to the application of relevant tax laws.54Table of Contents            Valuation of acquired developed product technology intangible assets - BioTek acquisitionAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of BioTek for consideration of $1.17 billion, of which $387 million of developed product technology intangible assets were recorded. Management estimated the fair value of the developed product technology using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach by discounting forecasted future cash flows directly related to products expecting to result from the projects, net of returns on contributory assets. Management’s determination of the fair value of the developed product technology intangible assets acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and the discount rates.    The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of acquired developed product technology intangible assets in connection with the BioTek acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of acquired developed product technology intangible assets due to the significant amount of judgment by management when developing the estimate, (ii) significant audit effort was required in evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimate, such as the revenue growth rates and the discount rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.   Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the acquired developed product technology intangible assets and controls over the development of the assumptions related to the valuation of the acquired developed product technology intangible assets, including the revenue growth rates and the discount rates. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement, testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology intangible assets, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in estimating the fair value of the acquired developed technology intangible assets, and evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions, including the revenue growth rates and the discount rates.  Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates involved considering the past performance of the acquired business, as well as economic and industry forecasts.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s fair value estimate and certain significant assumptions, including the discount rates./s/

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESOverview.    Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Basis of Presentation.    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.Principles of Consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Use of Estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes.Retirement of Treasury Shares.  Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital, based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings.  All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606’’). See also Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" and Note 4, ""Revenue"" for additional information on revenue recognition.Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. 61Table of Contents            We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Standalone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance.Deferred Revenue.    Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements (performance obligations) to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either in current liabilities in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation.Accounts Receivable, net.    Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2019 and 2018 was not material. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of estimated product returns which are not material.Shipping and Handling Costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.Inventory.    Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.Acquisitions.   Agilent accounts for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting and we allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life.Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and IPR&D acquired involve significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer 62Table of Contents            relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2019, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2019, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2019. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Share-Based Compensation.    For the years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program (""LTPP"") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting.  Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $72 million in 2019, $71 million in 2018 and $61 million in 2017. See Note 5, ""Share-based Compensation"" for additional information.63Table of Contents            Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans.   Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans.  Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.   Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually.   See Note 14, “Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans” for additional information. Taxes on Income.    Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 6, ""Income Taxes"" for more information.Warranty.    Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 15, ""Guarantees"".Advertising.    Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $36 million in 2019, $41 million in 2018 and $38 million in 2017.Research and Development.    Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Sales Taxes.    Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.Net Income Per Share.    Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 7, ""Net Income Per Share"".Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments.  We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.As of October 31, 2019, approximately $1,310 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.We classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Currently, we have no short-term investments.Variable Interest Entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).  The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We account for these investments under either the equity method or as equity investments without determinable fair value, depending on the circumstances.  We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. During the year ended October 31, 2016, Agilent made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen, Inc. (""Lasergen"") for $80 million.  This investment in Lasergen was accounted for under the cost method.  Agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and included an option to acquire the remaining shares until March 2018. During the year ended October 31, 2018, we exercised our option and acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen that we did not already own for an additional cash consideration of approximately $107 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition 64Table of Contents            resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income. Lasergen was previously considered a VIE.  As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, we have no material VIE's.Investments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value consist of non-marketable equity securities (typically investments in privately-held companies). These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost and we adjust for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) included in net income as and when it occurs. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Prior to fiscal year 2019, both equity investments without determinable fair value and with determinable fair value were accounted for using cost method of accounting, measured at historical cost less other-than-temporary investment. Trading securities, which is comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, other investments and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of October 31, 2019 and 2018. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments which are readily determinable, and which are not accounted under the equity method are reported at fair value using quoted market prices for those securities when available with gains and losses included in net income. The fair value of long-term equity investments which are not readily determinable, and which are not accounted under the equity method are reported at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments included in net income. The fair value of our senior notes, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy exceeds the carrying value by approximately $62 million as of October 31, 2019 and is lower than the carrying value by approximately $15 million as of October 31, 2018. The change in the fair value over carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2019 is primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.  The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 12, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.Concentration of Credit Risk.    Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.  Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of accounts receivable as of October 31, 2019, or 2018.Derivative Instruments.    Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options, interest rate swaps and interest rate locks to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies. Foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months, interest rate swaps mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt and interest rate locks mature at the same time as the issuance of debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.65Table of Contents            All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedges, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was not material.  Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.Property, Plant and Equipment.    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over 3 years to 10 years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.Leases.    We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating and capital leases for original terms ranging generally from less than 1 year to 30 years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to 6 years. In addition, we lease equipment to customers in connection with our diagnostics business using both capital and operating leases. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018 our diagnostics and genomics segment has approximately $37 million and $32 million, respectively, of lease receivables related to capital leases and approximately $17 million and $20 million, respectively, of net assets for operating leases.  We depreciate the assets related to the operating leases over their estimated useful lives, typically five years.Capitalized Software.    We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over 3 years to 5 years once development is complete.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2019, there were no impairments of other assets or intangible assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable. During 2017, there were no impairments of other assets or intangible assets.Employee Compensation and Benefits.    Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $115 million and $107 million as of October 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.Foreign Currency Translation.    We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and were $7 million loss for 2019, $3 million loss for 2018 and $2 million loss for 2017. 66Table of Contents            2.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, ASC Topic 606, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The objective of the new revenue standard is to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Under the new guidance, there are specific criteria to determine if a performance obligation should be recognized over time or at a point in time.On November 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective approach only to contracts not completed as of this date. Results for reporting periods after November 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.We recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $23 million as of November 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606. The impact to beginning retained earnings is primarily due to an increase in contract assets (unbilled accounts receivable), a reduction in inventory and a reduction in contract liabilities (deferred revenue). The net increase in retained earnings and resulting changes in assets and liabilities was mainly driven by the change in timing of the recognition of revenue from the fulfillment of separate performance obligations as control transfers to the customer. Had we continued to use the revenue recognition guidance in effect prior to fiscal year 2019, no material changes would have resulted to the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, or cash flows for the year ended October 31, 2019. As a result, comparisons of revenue and operating profit performance between periods are not materially affected by the adoption of this standard. Refer to Note 1, ""Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies""for a description of the company’s revenue recognition policies and Note 4, ""Revenue"" for the disclosures required by the standard.As of November 1, 2018, we elected to early adopt new accounting guidance which amends reporting comprehensive income to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") to retained earnings for the deferred taxes previously recorded in AOCI that exceed the current federal tax rate of 21 percent resulting from the enacted corporate tax rate in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Tax Act"").  The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of $7 million from AOCI to beginning retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheet.As of November 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance which eliminates the exception in ASC 740, Income Taxes against immediate recognition of income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  The amendment in this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of period of adoption. We recorded a net decrease in beginning retained earnings of $2 million as of November 1, 2018 due to removing unamortized tax expense previously deferred.As of November 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments and also the related guidance which addresses technical corrections and improvements to this guidance. The guidance requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The total impact of adoption to our consolidated balance sheet was an increase of $7 million to long-term investments and a net increase of $5 million to beginning retained earnings.67Table of Contents            The following table summarizes the impacts of recently adopted accounting pronouncements on our consolidated balance sheet as of November 1, 2018: October 31, 2018 Impact of Adopting New November 1, 2018 As Reported Revenue Recognition Guidance Tax Effects on Items in AOCI Guidance Intra-Entity Tax Guidance Investments Valuation Guidance As Adopted (in millions)ASSETS           Current assets:           Cash and cash equivalents$2,247 $— $— $— $— $2,247Accounts receivable, net776 24 — — — 800Inventory638 (10) — — — 628Other current assets187 3 — — — 190Total current assets3,848 17 — — — 3,865Property, plant and equipment, net822 — — — — 822Goodwill2,973 — — — — 2,973Other intangible assets, net491 — — — — 491Long-term investments68 — — — 7 75Other assets339 (3) — (2) (2) 332Total assets$8,541 $14 $— $(2) $5 $8,558LIABILITIES AND EQUITY           Current liabilities:           Accounts payable$340 $— $— $— $— $340Employee compensation and benefits304 — — — — 304Deferred revenue324 (11) — — — 313Other accrued liabilities203 — — — — 203Total current liabilities1,171 (11) — — — 1,160Long-term debt1,799 — — — — 1,799Retirement and post-retirement benefits239 — — — — 239Other long-term liabilities761 2 — — — 763Total liabilities3,970 (9) — — — 3,961            Total equity:           Stockholders’ equity:           Preferred stock; $0.01 par value; 125 million shares authorized; none issued and outstanding— — — — — —Common stock; $0.01 par value; 2 billion shares authorized; 318 million shares at October 31, 2018 issued3 — — — — 3Additional paid-in-capital5,308 — — — — 5,308Accumulated deficit(336) 23 7 (2) 5 (303)Accumulated other comprehensive loss(408) — (7) — — (415)Total stockholders' equity4,567 23 — (2) 5 4,593Non-controlling interest4 — — — — 4Total equity4,571 23 — (2) 5 4,597Total liabilities and equity$8,541 $14 $— $(2) $5 $8,55868Table of Contents            As of November 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash to the consolidated balance sheet follows: October 31 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)  Cash and cash equivalents$1,382 $2,247 $2,678Restricted cash included in other assets6 7 8Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$1,388 $2,254 $2,686As of November 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance which requires employers that present a measure of operating income in their statements of operations to include only the service cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in operating expenses. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost should be presented in the same operating expense line items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, including interest costs, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost/credit and actuarial gains/losses, and settlement and curtailment effects, are to be included separately and outside of any subtotal of operating income. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of income from our income from operations to other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations of approximately $10 million, $24 million and $34 million in the year ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  As adoption is required to be on a retrospective basis, we have recast our historical consolidated statements of operations and segment information to conform to current year presentation. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets (""ROU"") and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. On November 1, 2019, we adopted the lease accounting guidance using the modified retrospective method for all lease arrangements at the beginning of the period of adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning November 1, 2019 will be presented under the new accounting guidance, while prior period amounts will not be adjusted. As of November 1, 2019, the new accounting guidance had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but is expected to have an insignificant impact on the consolidated net income and cash flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while the accounting for capital leases remained substantially unchanged. For leases that commenced before the effective date of adoption of the new accounting guidance, we elected the permitted practical expedients to not reassess the following: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) capitalization of initial direct costs for any existing leases.As a result of the cumulative impact of adopting the new accounting guidance we will record operating lease ROU assets  around $195 million and operating lease liabilities of the same amounts, primarily related to real estate and automobile leases.The accounting applied to lease arrangements in which we are the lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the prior standard and will not have a significant impact to our consolidated balance sheet, net income or cash flowsIn January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amendment also simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  We do not expect to early adopt nor do we expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.69Table of Contents            In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement which eliminates certain disclosure requirements and modifies others. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020, and for interim periods within that year with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the effectiveness of disclosures for defined benefit plans under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 715-20. The amendments in this guidance remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.     ACQUISITIONSAcquisition of BioTek and ACEAOn August 23, 2019 we completed the acquisition of privately-owned Lionheart Technologies LLC (""BioTek""), a leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of innovative life science instrumentation for $1.17 billion, under the merger agreement. As a result of the acquisition, BioTek has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Accordingly, the results of BioTek are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. For the period from August 24, 2019 to October 31, 2019, BioTek’s net revenue was $35 million and net loss was $12 million.  The acquisition of BioTek and its portfolio is another step to expand our position in the cell analysis market.The consideration paid was $1.17 billion.  Agilent funded the acquisition using existing cash of $470 million and debt of $700 million. The BioTek acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by Agilent at their estimated fair values. Agilent determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, and estimates made by management. We expect to realize revenue synergies, leverage and expand the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of BioTek’s net identifiable assets acquired (see summary of net assets below), and, as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. Goodwill acquired was allocated to our operating segments and reporting units as a part of the purchase price allocation. All goodwill was allocated to the life sciences and applied markets reporting unit. Agilent’s acquisition of BioTek is treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes.  The tax basis of the acquired assets equals the fair market value on acquisition date.70Table of Contents            The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date of August 23, 2019 (in millions):Cash and cash equivalents  $10 Accounts receivable  28 Inventories  21 Other current assets  2 Property, plant and equipment  8 Intangible assets  641 Goodwill  483 Total assets acquired 1,193  Accounts payable  (4) Deferred revenue  (5) Employee compensation and benefits  (7) Other accrued liabilities  (2) Long-term debt  (4) Net assets acquired  $1,171 The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities were generally determined using historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair values for acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue were determined with the input from third party valuation specialists. The fair values of certain other assets, inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments, long-term debt, and certain other long-term liabilities were determined internally using historical carrying values and estimates made by management. Valuations of intangible assets acquired The components of intangible assets acquired in connection with the BioTek acquisition were as follows (in millions): Fair Value EstimatedUseful LifeDeveloped product technology $387  5-13 yearsCustomer relationships 202  3-8 yearsBacklog 5  2 monthsTradenames and trademarks 43  10 yearsTotal intangible assets subject to amortization 637   In-process research and development 4   Total intangible assets $641   As noted above, the intangible assets, including in-process research and development, were valued with input from valuation specialists. Agilent used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the BioTek acquisition.  Specifically, the developed product technology and in-process research and development were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach by discounting forecasted cash flows directly related to the products expecting to result from the projects, net of returns on contributory assets.  The Company utilized the incremental cash flow method for determining the fair value of the customer relationships acquired, and the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the tradename. Order backlog was valued on a direct cash flow basis. The primary in-process research and development project acquired relates to a next version of a product which will be released in 2020.  Total costs to complete for all BioTek in-process research and development were estimated at approximately $2 million as of the close date.71Table of Contents            Acquisition and integration costs directly related to the BioTek acquisition totaled $4 million for the year ended October 31, 2019 and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Such costs are expensed in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance.On November 14, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences (“ACEA”), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million. The financial results of ACEA have been included in our financial results from the acquisition date. The following represents the unaudited proforma operating results as if BioTek and ACEA had been included in the company's consolidated statements of operations as of the beginning of fiscal 2018 (in millions, except per share amounts):  2019 2018Net revenue$5,308 $5,112Net income$1,012 $210Net income per share — basic$3.22 $0.65Net income per share — diluted$3.18 $0.65The unaudited proforma financial information assumes that the companies were combined as of November 1, 2017 and include business combination accounting effects from the acquisition including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, the impact on cost of sales due to the respective estimated fair value adjustments to inventory, changes to interest income for cash used in the acquisition, interest expense and currency losses associated with debt paid in connection with the acquisition and acquisition related transaction costs and tax related effects. The proforma information as presented above is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2018. The unaudited proforma financial information for the year ended October 31, 2019 combines the historical results of Agilent for the year ended October 31, 2019 (which includes BioTek and ACEA after the acquisition date) and for BioTek for the ten months ended August 23, 2019. The unaudited proforma financial information for the year ended October 31, 2018 combines the historical results of Agilent and ACEA for the year ended October 31, 2018 and BioTek for the year ended December 31, 2018 (due to differences in reporting periods).4.     REVENUEThe following table presents the company’s total revenue and segment revenue disaggregated by geographical region:  Year Ended October 31, 2019 Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab Total (in millions)Revenue by Region       Americas$692 $505 $664 $1,861Europe551 368 522 1,441Asia Pacific1,059 148 654 1,861Total$2,302 $1,021 $1,840 $5,163        72Table of Contents            The following table presents the company’s total revenue disaggregated by end markets and by revenue type:   Year Ended October 31, 2019 (in millions)Revenue by End Markets  Pharmaceutical and Biopharmaceutical $1,604Chemical and Energy 1,199Diagnostics and Clinical 785Food 486Academia and Government 474Environmental and Forensics 615Total $5,163   Revenue by Type  Instrumentation $2,150Non-instrumentation and other 3,013Total $5,163Revenue by region is based on the ship to location of the customer. Revenue by end market is determined by the market indicator of the customer and by customer type. Instrumentation revenue includes sales from instruments, remarketed instruments and third-party products. Non-instrumentation and other revenue includes sales from contract and per incident services, our companion diagnostics and our nucleic acid solutions businesses as well as sales from spare parts, consumables, reagents, vacuum pumps, subscriptions, software licenses and associated services.Contract BalancesContract Assets Contract assets (unbilled accounts receivable) primarily relate to the company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The unbilled receivables are reclassified to trade receivables when billed to customers. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets and are included in ""Accounts receivable, net"" in the consolidated balance sheet. The balance of contract assets as of October 31, 2019 and as of November 1, 2018, the date of adoption of ASC 606, were $110 million and $57 million, respectively. The increase in unbilled receivables during the year ended October 31, 2019 is a result of recognition of revenue upon the transfer of the control to the customer. In some instances, transfer of control is prior to invoicing the customers and excluding amounts transferred to trade receivables during the period amounted to $53 million.73Table of Contents            Contract LiabilitiesThe following table provides information about contract liabilities (deferred revenue) and the significant changes in the balances during the year ended October 31, 2019:   Contract Liabilities  (in millions)   Ending balance as of October 31, 2018 $367Impact of adoption of new revenue recognition guidance (11)Net revenue deferred in the period 303Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period (287)Change in deferrals from customer cash advances, net of revenue recognized 5Contract liabilities acquired in business combinations 9Currency translation and other adjustments —Ending balance as of October 31, 2019 $386Contract liabilities primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either current in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation.Contract CostsIncremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognized as an asset if it expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. The change in total capitalized costs to obtain a contract was immaterial during the year ended October 31, 2019 and are included in other current and long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We have applied the practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include the company's internal sales force compensation program, as we have determined that annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations   We have applied the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and have not disclosed information about transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. The estimated revenue expected to be recognized for remaining performance obligations that have an original term of more than one year, as of October 31, 2019, was $207 million, the majority of which is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligations primarily include extended warranty, customer manufacturing contracts, and software maintenance contracts and revenue associated with lease arrangements. 5.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. 74Table of Contents            Description of Share-Based PlansEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.    Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. Currently, there are 75 million shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP.Under our ESPP, employees purchased 603,488 shares for $37 million in 2019, 558,116 shares for $32 million in 2018 and 618,270 shares for $26 million in 2017. As of October 31, 2019, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 26,055,571. This excludes the number of shares of common stock to be issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participant contributions totaling $20 million as of October 31, 2019.Incentive Compensation Plans.    On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the ""2018 Plan"") which amends, including renaming and extending the term of, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the ""2009 Plan"").  The 2009 plan replaced the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (""SARs""), restricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2018 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2019, 28,676,526 shares were available for future awards under the 2018 Stock Plan.Stock options under the 2018 Stock Plan may be either ""incentive stock options"", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options were granted prior to November 1, 2015 and generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. Agilent issues new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program administered under the 2018 Stock Plan, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets over the three-year period are met.   The performance target for grants made in 2016  were based on Operating Margin (“OM”) and the performance grants made in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were based on Earnings Per Share (""EPS""). In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period were set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period are set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Based on the performance metrics the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years and the maximum award value for awards granted in 2017 and 2016 cannot exceed 300 percent of the grant date target value. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met.We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Impact of Share-based Compensation AwardsWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.75Table of Contents            The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Cost of products and services$18 $16 $15Research and development7 7 6Selling, general and administrative47 48 40Total share-based compensation expense$72 $71 $61At October 31, 2019 and 2018 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory. Valuation AssumptionsFor all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date.The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and as appropriate, a discount related to the one-year post vesting. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of awards granted. Years Ended October 31, 2019 2018 2017LTPP:     Volatility of Agilent shares22% 21% 23%Volatility of selected peer-company shares15%-66% 14%-66% 15%-63%Pair-wise correlation with selected peers30% 32% 36%      Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards5.0% 4.8% 5.3%Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2017 and thereafter, we used our own historical stock price volatility.           All LTPP awards granted to our executives have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares. 76Table of Contents            Share-Based Payment Award ActivityEmployee Stock OptionsThe following table summarizes employee stock option award activity of our employees and directors for 2019.  OptionsOutstanding  WeightedAverageExercise Price (in thousands)  Outstanding at October 31, 20181,997 $35Exercised(552) $33Forfeited— $—Outstanding at October 31, 20191,445 $36The options outstanding and exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October 31, 2019 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options ExercisableRange ofExercise PricesNumberOutstanding WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue NumberExercisable WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue (in thousands) (in years)   (in thousands) (in thousands) (in years)   (in thousands)$25.01 - 30483 2.5 $26 23,769 483 2.5 $26 23,769$30.01 - 40296 4.1 $39 10,845 296 4.1 $39 10,845$40.01 - over666 5.0 $41 23,211 666 5.0 $41 23,211 1,445 4.0 $36 $57,825 1,445 4.0 $36 $57,825The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $75.75 at October 31, 2019, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date.

For the year ended October 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.As part of the business integration of some of our prior acquisitions, we undertook corporate restructurings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 that involved on-shoring certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States.  These restructurings resulted in a cash tax liability of $231 million.  These taxes generate tax attributes that will offset our transition tax liability which is included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  For 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) as discussed below.For 2017, the company’s income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. Other tax holidays are due for renewal in 2020. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $368 million, $87 million, and $93 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $1.16, $0.27, and $0.29 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the benefit from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to the Singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2019 in response to Singapore tax law changes. Of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the Singapore restructuring.2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.The Tax Act also established new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on 79Table of Contents            dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (""FDII""); (6) repealing domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (""SAB 118"") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. For the year ended October 31, 2018, the company recognized income tax expense related to the Tax Act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate as described below. Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (""Transition Tax""): The Transition Tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P"") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-U.S. taxes paid (Tax Pools) on such earnings. Historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 E&P outside the U.S. For the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. Since the Tax Act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition U.S. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. The resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the Tax Act. We have completed our accounting for charges related to the Transition Tax.Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate:  The reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. The amount recorded for the year ended October31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. We have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes.GILTI:  The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI.  U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”).  We have completed our analysis and elected to treat GILTI as a “current period cost”.Indefinite Reinvestment Assertion: Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. The company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $10 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.80Table of Contents            The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: Years Ended October 31, 2019 2018 (in millions)Deferred Tax Assets   Intangibles$131 $—Property, plant and equipment— 8Pension benefits and retiree medical benefits71 49Employee benefits, other than retirement34 34Net operating loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards195 185Share-based compensation32 31Deferred revenue38 38Other35 19Deferred tax assets$536 $364Tax valuation allowance(134) (135)Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance$402 $229    Deferred Tax Liabilities   Intangibles$— $(112)Property, plant and equipment(16) —Other(7) (21)Deferred tax liabilities$(23) $(133)Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)$379 $96The increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 for the deferred tax asset and liabilities was primarily due to the benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company’s tax incentive in Singapore.Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2019, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $134 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred tax assets for the states of California and Colorado, along with the net operating losses in the Netherlands and capital losses in the U.S. and Australia.At October 31, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $48 million, $571 million and $577 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020. If not utilized, $155 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020. The remaining $422 million of the foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2019, we had federal and foreign capital loss carryforwards of $48 million and $116 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2022. The foreign capital losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2019, we had state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $78 million. The state tax credits carry forward indefinitely. The breakdown between long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows: October 31, 2019 2018 (in millions)Long-term deferred tax assets (included within other assets)$410 $165Long-term deferred tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(31) (69)Total$379 $9681Table of Contents            The breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows: October 31, 2019 2018 (in millions)Current income tax assets (included within other current assets)$68 $59Long-term income tax assets (included within other assets)4 19Current income tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities)(292) (71)Long-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(328) (607)Total$(548) $(600)Uncertain Tax PositionsThe aggregate changes in the balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Balance, beginning of year$214 $224 $293Additions for tax positions related to the current year7 27 32Additions for tax positions from prior years12 2 1Reductions for tax positions from prior years(2) (13) (3)Settlements with taxing authorities— — (52)Statute of limitations expirations(25) (26) (47)Balance, end of year$206 $214 $224As of October 31, 2019, we had $227 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties of which $204 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. However, approximately $23 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions that, if recognized, would be in the form of a deferred tax asset that would likely not affect our effective tax rate due to a valuation allowance.We recognized a tax expense of $9 million, a tax expense of $11 million and a tax benefit of $9 million of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2019 and 2018 were $36 million and $27 million, respectively.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2016 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2015 for significant states. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2009. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.82Table of Contents            7.     NET INCOME PER SHAREThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below.  Years Ended October 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Numerator:     Net income$1,071 $316 $684Denominators:     Basic weighted average shares314 321 $322Potential common shares — stock options and other employee stock plans4 4 4Diluted weighted average shares318 325 326The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we issued approximately 2 million, 2 million and 3 million, of share-based awards, respectively.  For the years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, the impact of the anti-dilutive potential common shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was not material.8.     INVENTORY October 31, 2019 2018 (in millions)Finished goods$416 $386Purchased parts and fabricated assemblies263 252Inventory$679 $638Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges of $19 million were recorded in cost of products in 2019, $26 million in 2018 and $24 million in 2017.

In 2019 we retired approximately $23 million of fully depreciated assets that were no longer in use.10.   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe following table presents goodwill balances and the movements for each of our reportable segments during the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2019: Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab Total (in millions)Goodwill as of October 31, 2017$773 $1,330 $504 $2,607Foreign currency translation impact(7) (4) (4) (15)Goodwill arising from acquisitions37 281 63 381Goodwill as of October 31, 2018$803 $1,607 $563 $2,973Foreign currency translation impact(1) (2) (2) (5)Goodwill arising from acquisitions and adjustments636 (11) — 625Goodwill as of October 31, 2019$1,438 $1,594 $561 $3,593        As of September 30, 2019, our annual impairment test date, we assessed goodwill impairment for our reporting units and no impairment was indicated.84Table of Contents            The component parts of other intangible assets at October 31, 2018 and 2019 are shown in the table below: Other Intangible Assets GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortizationand Impairments Net BookValue (in millions)As of October 31, 2018:     Purchased technology$947 $683 $264Trademark/Tradename151 88 63Customer relationships107 63 44Third-party technology and licenses$28 $19 $9Total amortizable intangible assets$1,233 $853 $380In-Process R&D111 — 111Total$1,344 $853 $491As of October 31, 2019:     Purchased technology$1,413 $763 $650Backlog5 5 —Trademark/Tradename196 102 94Customer relationships329 87 242Third-party technology and licenses$28 $22 $6Total amortizable intangible assets$1,971 $979 $992In-Process R&D115 — 115Total$2,086 $979 $1,107      In 2019, we acquired two businesses, BioTek and ACEA, for a combined purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion.  See Note 3, ""Acquisitions"", for additional information.During fiscal year 2019, we recorded additions to goodwill of $636 million and to other intangible assets of $744 million related to the acquisition of ACEA and BioTek. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded a measurement period adjustment to goodwill of $11 million for deferred tax assets related to pre-acquisition net operating losses of Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. The increase to other intangible assets due to foreign currency translation was not material in 2019.During fiscal year 2018, we recorded additions to goodwill of $381 million and to intangible assets of $262 million related to the acquisition of seven businesses. During the year other intangible assets decreased $1 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. In general, for United States federal tax purposes, goodwill from asset purchases is amortizable however any goodwill created as part of a stock acquisition is not deductible.In 2019, there were no impairments of other intangible assets recorded. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable. In 2017, there were no impairments of other intangible assets recorded.Amortization expense of intangible assets was $128 million in 2019, $110 million in 2018, and $120 million in 2017. Future amortization expense related to existing finite-lived purchased intangible assets associated with business combinations for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is estimated below:Estimated future amortization expense:  (in millions)2020$1862021$1722022$1502023$1072024$86Thereafter$29185Table of Contents            11.   INVESTMENTSThe following table summarizes the company's equity investments as of October 31, 2019 and 2018 (net book value): October 31, 2019 2018 (in millions)Long-Term   Equity investments - without readily determinable fair value$47 $23Equity investments - with readily determinable fair value25 15Trading securities30 30Total$102 $68Equity investments without readily determinable fair value (RDFV) consist of non-marketable equity securities issued by private companies. These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost adjusting for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer). The adjustments are included in net income in the period in which they occur. Equity investments with RDFV consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Prior to fiscal year 2019, both equity investments without RDFV and with RDFV were accounted for using cost method of accounting, measured at historical cost less other-than-temporary impairment. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.During 2018, we acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen, Inc. (Lasergen), for an additional cash consideration of approximately $107 million, an investment that was accounted for under the cost method in 2017 for approximately $80 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income. Our investments without RDFV, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment.Net unrealized gains on our equity securities with RDFV were $3 million in 2019. Net unrealized gains on our equity securities without RDFV were not material in 2019. Upon adoption of new accounting guidance relating to financial instruments beginning fiscal year 2019, the gains and losses on such securities are recognized in other income (expense) and therefore not applicable in prior periods. As of November 1, 2019, total impact of adoption of said accounting guidance to our consolidated balance sheet was an increase of $7 million to equity securities with RDFV (included within long-term investments) and a net increase of$5 million to beginning retained earnings.Net unrealized gains on our trading securities portfolio were $3 million in 2019, $1 million in 2018 and $4 million in 2017.12.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.Fair Value HierarchyThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 86Table of Contents            observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2019 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement                                                                 at October 31, 2019 Using October 31, 2019 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$784 $784 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)12 — 12 —Long-term       Trading securities30 30 — —Other investments25 — 25 —Total assets measured at fair value$851 $814 $37 $—Liabilities:       Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$6 $— $6 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability30 — 30 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$36 $— $36 $—87Table of Contents            Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2018 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement                                                                    at October 31, 2018 Using October 31, 2018 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,355 $1,355 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)16 — 16 —Long-term       Trading securities30 30 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,401 $1,385 $16 $—Liabilities:      Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$5 $— $5 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability30 — 30 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$35 $— $35 $—Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because, although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable. Other investments represent shares we own in a special fund that targets underlying investments of approximately 40 percent in debt securities and 60 percent in equity securities. It has been classified as level 2 because, although the shares of the fund are not traded on any active stock exchange, each of the individual underlying securities are and hence we have a readily determinable value for the underlying securities, from which we are able to determine the fair market value for the special fund itself.Trading securities, which is comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, other investments and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisLong-Lived AssetsFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Years EndedOctober 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Long-lived assets held and used$— $21 $—Long-lived assets held for sale$— $— $—88Table of Contents            There were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used in 2019 and 2017. For 2018, long lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $21 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $21 million, which relates to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable and was included in net income.  There were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2019, 2018 and 2017.Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets during 2018 were measured using level 3 inputs. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets in 2018, we used the income approach based on projected discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets over the remaining useful life.For 2019, there were no impairments or material changes in non-marketable securities without readily determinable fair value. As of October 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, the carrying amount of non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values was $47 million and $23 million, respectively.Fair values for the non-marketable securities included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet were measured using Level 3 inputs because they are primarily equity stock issued by private companies without quoted market prices. To estimate the fair value of our non-marketable securities, we use the measurement alternative to record these investments at cost and to adjust for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) as and when it occurs.13.   DERIVATIVESWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts purchased options to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Fair Value HedgesWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. The fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and, in the past, we have used interest rate swaps to change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. As of October 31, 2019, all interest rate swap contracts had either been terminated or had expired. On August 9, 2011, we terminated five interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. On September 17, 2019, the 2020 senior notes were redeemed, and the remaining gain associated with the terminated interest rate swap contracts was realized.Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. For open contracts as of October 31, 2019 and entered into on or after November 1, 2018, changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in cost of sales over the life of the foreign exchange contract. The changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to other income (expense), net in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in cost of sales over the 89Table of Contents            life of the option contract.  For the years ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, ineffectiveness and gains and losses recognized in other income (expense),net due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012.  We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2019 was $1 million. In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2019 was $7 million. In August 2019, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $250 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2029 senior notes issued on September 5, 2019. We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 6, 2019 and we recognized a deferred loss of $6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2029 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2019 was $6 million. Other HedgesAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense),net in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2019, was $2 million. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2019.90Table of Contents            There were 261 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2019 and designated as cash flow hedges.

Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.Agilent provides defined benefits to U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the ""RP""). For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the ""DPSP""), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $132 million and $141 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.Effective November 1, 2014, Agilent’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan was closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires.  As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen. Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there are no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016.Agilent also maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""SBRP"") in the U.S., which is a supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the ""U.S. Plans"" in the tables below.Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements.92Table of Contents            Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Plans.    In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. –Eligible retirees who were less than age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for a fixed amount which can be utilized to pay for either sponsored plans and/or individual Medicare  plans. –Effective January 1, 2012, employees who were at least age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for fixed dollar subsidies and stipends. Grandfathered retirees receive a fixed monthly subsidy toward pre-65 premium costs (subsidy capped at 2011 levels) and a fixed monthly stipend post-65. The subsidy amounts will not increase. –Any new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the retiree medical plans upon retiring.  –As of April 30, 2016, benefits under this plan were changed for Active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service, as of April 30, 2016 - for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan   These employees will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement.401(k) Defined Contribution Plan.    Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan.  Effective April 30, 2016, we began matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation.  Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen.  The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $39 million in 2019, $37 million in 2018 and $33 million in 2017.Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law. In Japan, Agilent has employees' pension fund plans, which are defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law (JWPIL). The plans are composed of (a) a substitutional portion based on the pay-related part of the old-age pension benefits prescribed by JWPIL (similar to social security benefits in the United States) and (b) a corporate portion based on a contributory defined benefit pension arrangement established at the discretion of the company. During the year ended October 31, 2017, Agilent received government approval and returned the substitutional portion of Japan's pension plan to the Japanese government, as allowed by the JWPIL. The initial transfer resulted in a net gain of $32 million recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The net gain consisted of two parts - a gain of $41 million, representing the difference between the fair values of the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) settled of $65 million and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan of $24 million, offset by a settlement loss of $9 million related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, after the Japanese government’s final review of our initial payment, we received a refund of  $5 million which was recorded as a settlement gain.93Table of Contents            Components of Net periodic cost.   The service cost component is recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. All other cost components are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.For the years ended October 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of:  Pensions U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans                    2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)                 Service cost — benefits earned during the period$— $— $— $20 $20 $19 $— $1 $1Interest cost on benefit obligation18 16 15 14 13 12 4 3 3Expected return on plan assets(27) (28) (25) (43) (46) (41) (7) (7) (7)Amortization of net actuarial loss1 1 3 34 29 36 4 8 11Amortization of prior service benefit— — — — — — (8) (8) (9)Total periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(8) $(11) $(7) $25 $16 $26 $(7) $(3) $(1)Curtailments and settlements$— $— $— $— $(5) $(32) $— $— $—Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss                 Net actuarial (gain) loss$51 $2 $(19) $104 $49 $(128) $5 $(2) $(9)Amortization of net actuarial loss(1) (1) (3) (34) (29) (36) (4) (8) (11)Prior service cost (benefit)— — — — — — — — —Amortization of prior service benefit— — — — — — 8 8 9Gain due to settlement— — — — — 32 — — —Foreign currency— — — (3) 1 2 — — —Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss$50 $1 $(22) $67 $21 $(130) $9 $(2) $(11)Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss$42 $(10) $(29) $92 $32 $(136) $2 $(5) $(12)94Table of Contents            Funded Status.    As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S.Post-RetirementBenefit Plans 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in millions)Change in fair value of plan assets:           Fair value — beginning of year$401 $414 $825 $855 $90 $95Actual return on plan assets50 8 85 (9) 11 1Employer contributions— — 21 21 — —Participants' contributions— — 1 — — —Benefits paid(19) (21) (29) (26) (6) (6)Settlements— — — 5 — —Currency impact— — 8 (21) — —Fair value — end of year$432 $401 $911 $825 $95 $90Change in benefit obligation:           Benefit obligation — beginning of year$420 $445 $913 $935 $87 $97Service cost— — 20 20 — 1Interest cost18 16 14 13 4 3Participants' contributions— — 1 — — —Plan amendment— — — 1 — —Actuarial (gain) loss74 (19) 143 (6) 9 (7)Benefits paid(21) (22) (29) (27) (6) (7)Currency impact— — 5 (23) — —Benefit obligation — end of year$491 $420 $1,067 $913 $94 $87Overfunded (underfunded) status of PBO$(59) $(19) $(156) $(88) $1 $3Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:           Other assets$— $— $106 $95 $1 $3Employee compensation and benefits(1) (1) — — — —Retirement and post-retirement benefits(58) (18) (262) (183) — —Total net asset (liability)$(59) $(19) $(156) $(88) $1 $3Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss):           Actuarial (gains) losses$115 $65 $330 $263 $10 $10Prior service costs (benefits)— — — — (12) (20)Total$115 $65 $330 $263 $(2) $(10)The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized by Agilent as components of net expense during 2020 are as follows: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit)$— $— $(7)Amortization of actuarial net loss (gain)$3 $48 $495Table of Contents            Investment Policies and Strategies as of October 31, 2019 and 2018. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 3 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 31 to 60 percent to equities, from 38 to 61 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2019 and 2018 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as the practical expedient.   In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund.Fair Value.    The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 12, ""Fair Value Measurements"".Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments.Equity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock that are not traded on an active market are valued at quoted prices reported by investment dealers based on the underlying terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Other Investments - Other investments also includes partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3.Agilent has adopted the accounting guidance related to the presentation of certain investments using the NAV practical expedient. The accounting guidance exempts investments using this practical expedient from categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 96Table of Contents            The following tables present the fair

fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to contribute to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the Post-Retirement Medical Plans.  We expect to contribute $24 million to plans outside the U.S.  The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)2020$35 $25 $82021$36 $27 $82022$33 $29 $72023$35 $32 $72024$37 $32 $72025 - 2029$146 $170 $35Assumptions.    The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2019 and 2018, were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally 100Table of Contents            based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2019 2018 2017U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate4.50% 3.75% 3.75%Expected long-term return on assets7.00% 7.00% 7.25%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate0.83-2.68% 0.67-2.52% 0.22-2.66%Average increase in compensation levels2.25-3.25% 2.00-3.25% 2.00-4.25%Expected long-term return on assets4.00-5.75% 4.00-6.00% 4.00-6.25%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:     Discount rate4.25% 3.50% 3.50%Expected long-term return on assets7.00% 7.00% 7.25%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 6.00% 6.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029 2029Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: As of the Years Ending October 31, 2019 2018U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate3.25% 4.50%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate0.22-1.81% 0.83-2.68%Average increase in compensation levels2.25-3.00% 2.25-3.25%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:   Discount rate3.00% 4.25%Current medical cost trend rate6.25% 6.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate4.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029Health care trend rates do not have a significant effect on the total service and interest cost components or on the post-retirement benefit obligation amounts reported for the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan for the year ended October 31, 2019.15.   GUARANTEESStandard WarrantyWe accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend to one years from the date of delivery, depending on the product.101Table of Contents            A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. The standard warranty accrual balances are recorded in other accrued liabilities. October 31, 2019 2018 (in millions)Balance as of October 31, 2018 and 2017$35 $34Accruals for warranties including change in estimates54 53Settlements made during the period(57) (52)Balance as of October 31, 2019 and 2018$32 $35Accruals for warranties due within one year32 35Bank GuaranteesGuarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and were approximately $40 million as of October 31, 2019. A standby letter of credit is a guarantee of payment issued by a bank on behalf of us that is used as payment of last resort should we fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party. A bank guarantee is a promise from a bank or other lending institution that if we default on a loan, the bank will cover the loss. Indemnifications in Connection with TransactionsIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2019.  Indemnifications to Officers and DirectorsOur corporate bylaws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the bylaws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our bylaws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2019.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2019.102Table of Contents            In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2019.16.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOperating Lease Commitments:    We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases.  Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense was $75 million in 2019, $64 million in 2018 and $57 million in 2017.Future non-cancelable minimum lease payments and future minimum lease income under operating leases at October 31, 2019:  Future Minimum Lease Payments Future Minimum Lease Income  (in millions)2020 $52 $82021 $41 $62022 $29 $52023 $21 $—2024 $14 $—Thereafter $56 $—Other Purchase Commitments.   Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled were approximately $77 million. Approximately $25 million of the penalties for the new contracts will reduce over the next 14 years.Contingencies:    We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, commercial, real estate, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.103Table of Contents            17.   SHORT-TERM DEBTCredit FacilitiesOn March 13, 2019, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024. The credit facility replaces the existing credit facility which terminated on the closing date of the new facility. For the year ended October 31, 2019, we borrowed $305 million and repaid $190 million under the credit facility. As of October 31, 2019, the company had borrowings of $115 million outstanding under the credit facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the year ended October 31, 2019.  On August 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provides for a $500 million short-term loan facility that was used in full to complete the BioTek acquisition and which is outstanding at October 31, 2019. On October 21, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement, which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to $500 million. We had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of October 31, 2019.Capital LeasesThe company leases certain property and equipment under capital leases. As of October 31, 2019, the current portion of the company’s capital lease obligations had an aggregate carrying value of $1 million. 2020 Senior NotesOn July 13, 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2020 senior notes""). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes were scheduled to mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million. The gain was deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.On September 17, 2019, we repaid the $500 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2020 senior notes due July 15, 2020 that were called for redemption on August 16, 2019. The redemption price of approximately $512 million included a $12 million prepayment penalty. The redemption price was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2020 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest related to the redemption.  The prepayment penalty plus amortization of the previously deferred interest swap gain of $4 million and amortization of previously deferred debt issuance costs and discount of $1 million was recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. We also paid accrued and unpaid interest of $4 million on the 2020 senior notes up to but not including the redemption date.2017 Senior Notes                                               On October 24, 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2017 senior notes""). On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes.  The 2017 senior notes were repayable within one year as of October 31, 2017 and were reclassified to short-term debt. The remaining $100 million in 2017 senior notes matured and were paid in full on November 1, 2017. 104Table of Contents            18.   LONG-TERM DEBTSenior NotesThe following table summarizes the company's long-term senior notes and the related interest rate swaps: October 31, 2019 October 31, 2018 AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total (in millions)2020 Senior Notes$— $— $— $499 $7 $5062022 Senior Notes399 — 399 399 — 3992023 Senior Notes597 — 597 597 — 5972026 Senior Notes298 — 298 297 — 2972029 Senior Notes492 — 492 — — —Total$1,786 $— $1,786 $1,792 $7 $1,7992020 Senior NotesThe 2020 senior notes were repaid in 2019, see Note 17, ""Short-Term Debt"".2022 Senior NotesOn September 10, 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes (""2022 senior notes"").

The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased and retired approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs.

We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.In 2019, we adopted new guidance related to the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. See Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" for more information.  As a result, we have recast our historical segment results to conform to this new presentation required under this guidance. A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; 108Table of Contents            microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (""MP-AES"") instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (""ICP-OES"") instruments; raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer; cell imaging systems; microplate reader; laboratory software for sample tracking; information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients (""APIs"") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (""NGS"") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. This business also includes solutions that enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (""GMP"") conditions for use as API in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Third, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings for cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (""IHC""), in situ hybridization (""ISH""), hematoxylin and eosin (""H&E"") staining and special staining. Fourth, we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Fifth, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. Finally, our biomolecular analysis business provides complete workflow solutions, including instruments, consumables and software, for quality control analysis of nucleic acid samples.  Samples are analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure accuracy in further genomics analysis techniques utilized in clinical and life science research applications. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.  Most of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices.  Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab.  Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies.  Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity.  Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements.A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, tax, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, order administration, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, pension curtailment or settlement gains, restructuring and transformational initiatives expenses, acquisition and integration costs, business exit and divestiture costs, special compliance costs, some nucleic acid solutions division (""NASD"") site costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, in-sourcing or outsourcing of activities.The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.109Table of Contents            The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, transformational initiatives, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab TotalSegments (in millions)Year Ended October 31, 2019:       Total net revenue$2,302 $1,021 $1,840 $5,163Income from operations$542 $185 $475 $1,202Depreciation expense$41 $35 $35 $111Share-based compensation expense$33 $14 $25 $72Year Ended October 31, 2018:       Total net revenue$2,270 $943 $1,701 $4,914Income from operations$543 $173 $388 $1,104Depreciation expense$38 $33 $31 $102Share-based compensation expense$33 $14 $24 $71Year Ended October 31, 2017:       Total net revenue$2,081 $860 $1,531 $4,472Income from operations$470 $167 $336 $973Depreciation expense$35 $30 $29 $94Share-based compensation expense$30 $10 $21 $61The following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Total reportable segments' income from operations$1,202 $1,104 $973Amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations(125) (105) (117)Acquisition and integration costs(48) (23) (30)Transformational initiatives(44) (25) (12)Asset impairments— (21) —Business exit and divestiture costs (primarily our NMR business)— (9) —NASD site costs(12) (8) —Special compliance costs(2) (4) —Other (1) (30) (5) (7)Interest Income36 38 22Interest Expense(74) (75) (79)Other income (expense), net16 79 53Income before taxes, as reported$919 $946 $803(1) The other category primarily includes legal costs related to our pursuing our claim against a third party in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments and settlements. Major Customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2019, 2018 or 2017.110Table of Contents            The following table reflects segment assets and capital expenditures under our management reporting system.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2019, the company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the company's reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"").  As a result of that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2019 based on criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.SEC staff guidance discusses the exclusion of an acquired business’s internal controls from management’s annual assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting when it is not possible to conduct assessments for the acquired business in the period between the acquisition date and the date of management’s assessment. The company completed the acquisitions of Lionheart Technologies LLC (""BioTek"") on August 23, 2019 and ACEA Biosciences (""ACEA"") on November 14, 2018. Management excluded both BioTek and ACEA from its assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2019.  BioTek and ACEA combined constituted approximately 2 percent of total assets and less than 2 percent of total revenue as of and for the year ended October 31, 2019.

Life Sciences and Applied MarketsOur life sciences and applied markets business focuses primarily on the following five markets:The Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, CRO & CMO Market.  This market consists of “for-profit” companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery & development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies (“pharma”). A second sub-segment includes biotechnology companies (“biotech”), contract research organizations (“CROs”) and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”). Biotech companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the pharmaceutical industry value chain. Additionally, due to the relatively low drug efficacy within oncology, pharma companies are partnering with diagnostic companies to bring validated tests to the market with their new drugs.The Academic and Government Market.  This market consists primarily of “not-for-profit” organizations and includes academic institutions, large government institutes and privately funded organizations. The academic and government market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments for pharmaceutical and molecular diagnostics companies. After decades of investment in basic biomedical research by government funding bodies, the focus has widened to include translational research - multidisciplinary scientific efforts directed at accelerating therapy development.The Chemical & Energy Market.    The natural gas and petroleum refining markets use our products to measure and control the quality of their finished products and to verify the environmental safety of their operations. Petroleum refiners use our measurement solutions to analyze crude oil composition, perform raw material analysis, verify and improve refining processes and ensure the overall quality of gasoline, fuels, lubricants and other products. Our solutions are also used in the development, manufacturing and quality control of fine chemicals and other industrial applications such as materials analysis.The Environmental & Forensics Market.    Our instruments, software and workflow solutions are used by the environmental market for applications such as laboratory and field analysis of chemical pollutants in air, water, soil and solid waste. Environmental industry customers include all levels of government, the industrial and manufacturing sectors, engineering and consulting companies, commercial testing laboratories and colleges and universities. Drug testing and forensics laboratories use our instruments, software and workflow solutions for applications such as analyzing evidence associated with crime, screening athletes for performance enhancing drugs, analyzing samples for recreational drugs, or detecting and identifying biological and chemical warfare agents. Some of our instruments are used in mobile laboratories as well. Customers include local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies and health laboratories.The Food Market.    Our instruments, software, and workflow solutions are used throughout the food production chain, including incoming inspection, new product development, quality control and assurance, and packaging. For example, our mass spectrometer portfolio is used to analyze contaminants and residual pesticides in food. There is also a significant food safety market involved in analyzing food for pathogen contamination, accurate verification of species type and evidence of genetically modified content.Life Sciences and Applied Markets Products and ApplicationsOur products fall into eight main areas of work: liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, software and informatics, lab automation and robotics, vacuum technology and cell analysis.4Table of Contents            Our key products and applications include the following technologies:Liquid ChromatographyA liquid chromatograph (""LC"") or a high performance liquid chromatograph (“HPLC”) is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi‑method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi‑dimensional LC and can be extended to application‑based analyzers e.g. for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatography. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements.Gas ChromatographyAgilent is the world's leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. GC's are used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. Agilent provides custom or standard analyzers configured for specific chemical analysis applications, such as detailed speciation of a complex hydrocarbon stream, calculation of gas calorific values in the field, or analysis of a new bio-fuel formulation. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments.Mass SpectrometryA mass spectrometer (“MS”) identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical's molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the MS system. The combined use of LC and MS is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also be used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent's LCMS portfolio includes instruments built around four main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, time-of-flight (“TOF”) and quadrupole time-of-flight (“QTOF”). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio in recent years with a focus on improving performance, sensitivity, and ease of use.SpectroscopySpectroscopy is a technique for analyzing the individual chemical components of substances based on the absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation of specific wavelengths of light. Our spectroscopy instruments include AA spectrometers, microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometers (“MP-AES”), ICP-OES, ICP-MS, fluorescence spectrophotometers, ultraviolet- visible (""UV-Vis"") spectrophotometers, Fourier Transform infrared (""FT-IR"") spectrophotometers, near-infrared (""NIR"") spectrophotometers, Raman spectrometers and sample automation products. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments.Software and InformaticsWe provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments.

In addition to product sales, we also offer a wide range of services including an exchange and rebuild program, assistance with the design and integration of vacuum systems, applications support and training in basic and advanced vacuum technologies.Cell AnalysisOur cell analysis tools are used to study cell signaling pathways, general cell function and behavior through metabolic profile analysis, real-time cellular impedance measurements, and traditional cytometry techniques. Characterizing cellular behavior and function is an increasingly critical step in understanding normal behavior versus diseased states, advancements of those diseases, and response to therapies, providing researchers with a more targeted approach for drug discovery and ultimately more effective therapeutics.  Cell analysis customers are typically academic institutions and pharma and bio-pharma companies.Life Sciences and Applied Markets CustomersWe had approximately 24,000 customers for our life sciences and applied markets business in fiscal 2018. No single customer represented a material amount of the net revenue of the life sciences and applied markets business. A significant number of our life sciences and applied markets customers are also customers of our Agilent CrossLab business.The life sciences and applied markets business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily related to U.S. and foreign government budgets, chemical and energy and environmental customers and large pharmaceutical company budgets. Historically, the result is that our first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year.Life Sciences and Applied Markets Sales, Marketing and SupportThe life sciences and applied markets channels focus on the therapeutics and human disease research customer base (pharma, biotech, CRO, CMO and generics), clinical customer base (high complexity clinical testing labs) and on emerging life sciences opportunities in life science research institutes. We deploy a multi-channel approach, marketing products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. We primarily use direct sales to market our solutions to our pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and clinical accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, electronic commerce and direct sales. Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost. Life Sciences and Applied Markets ManufacturingOur manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer‑centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. Our manufacturing process then converts these designs into standard as well as custom products for shipment to customers. We selectively use third parties to provide some supply chain processes for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California, Delaware and Massachusetts in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Germany, Malaysia and Singapore.  We have FDA registered sites in California, Germany and Singapore. Life Sciences and Applied Markets CompetitionThe markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition.

Finally, our biomolecular analysis business provides complete workflow solutions, including instruments, consumables and software, for quality control analysis of nucleic acid samples.  Samples are analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure accuracy in further genomics analysis techniques utilized in clinical and life science research applications.We employed approximately 2,500 people as of October 31, 2018 in our diagnostics and genomics business. Diagnostics and Genomics MarketWithin the diagnostics and genomics business, we focus primarily on the diagnostics and clinical market. A significant part of our clinical diagnostic customers are in pathology labs throughout the world.  Our high-quality, automated pathology tissue staining platforms and solutions are used most heavily by the large labs located in hospitals, medical centers, and reference labs.  The market is skewed towards mature economies, with most of the market in North America, Western Europe and Japan.  The mix is changing, however, as emerging markets increase spending on human health.The clinical market for genomics consists of high complexity clinical labs performing patient testing, including “for-profit” reference laboratories, hospital labs, and molecular diagnostic companies. While these labs primarily purchase in vitro diagnostics (“IVD”) labeled testing kits, they often develop and validate their own molecular based tests. Analyte Specific Reagents (“ASRs”) are often used by these labs.Diagnostics and Genomics ProductsOur products fall into eight main areas of work: pathology products, specific proteins and flow reagents, companion diagnostics, target enrichment, cytogenetic research solutions and microarrays, PCR and qPCR instrumentation and molecular biology reagents, nucleic acid solutions and automated electrophoresis and microfluidics.PathologyThis area consists of routine clinical solutions for tissue based cancer diagnostics with solutions that comprise antibodies, reagents, instruments and software targeting both primary and advanced cancer diagnostics. Our CoverStainer and Artisan based product families target primary cancer diagnostics through hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as special stains for additional insights and detection of potentially carcinogenic tissue. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched our combined IHC/ISH platform, Dako Omnis. The Dako Omnis and Autostainer based IHC solution and Instant Quality Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (""IQFISH"") technologies provide advanced tumor typing through investigation of protein and gene expression. These products also include companion diagnostic tests that are used to help identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy.Specific Proteins and Flow ReagentsOur reagent OEM business is a provider of clinical diagnostic products within the areas of specific proteins for turbidimetry and reagents for flow cytometry. These are sold to OEM customers as customized reagent solutions supplied to top IVD companies or through retail partners.7Table of Contents            Companion DiagnosticsIn our companion diagnostics business, we partner with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy.Target EnrichmentAgilent continues to be a strong player in the next generation sequencing market. We provide a target enrichment portfolio composed of two main platforms, SureSelect and HaloPlex, both enabling customers to select specific target regions of the genome for sequencing. Customers can customize our products for their regions of interest using the SureDesign software, or they can choose from a wide range of catalog products, including gene panels for specific applications and Exome designs, which allow analysis of the entire coding sequences of the genome. After preparing samples with SureSelect and HaloPlex, products can be sequenced in the main next generation sequencing platforms available in the market. The technologies provide an easy sample prep workflow that can be automated with the Agilent Bravo platform for scalability. HaloPlex provides less-than-24-hours fast workflow, which makes it suitable for labs that require fast turnaround time from sample to results. These products are used for mutation detection and genotyping. Results can be easily analyzed using Agilent software solutions GeneSpring or SureCall. Our  solutions also enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic diseases and help direct cancer therapy.Cytogenetic Research Solutions and MicroarraysAgilent is a leading provider of microarrays for comparative genomic hybridization (“CGH”), mostly used by customers in cytogenetic laboratories.  The arrays allow customers to detect genome-wide copy number alterations, with high levels of resolution (from entire chromosomal copy number changes to specific microdeletions or duplications). The arrays are offered in many formats allowing the customers to choose from different levels of resolution and number of samples per arrays. Arrays can also be customized using the SureDesign software. In addition to the microarrays, Agilent's solution includes reagents for sample processing, hardware for reading the microarrays, and software to help users view the data in a meaningful way.  In addition to the CGH portfolio, the cytogenetics solution comprises a line of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (""FISH"") called SureFISH. Over 400 probes are available in our catalog, covering most relevant regions in the genome. Cytogenetic labs can use SureFISH probes to detect specific translocations or copy number changes in samples. Additionally, Agilent provides a wide range of microarrays to the research market for different types of applications: gene expression, microRNA, methylation, splice variants, and chromatin immunoprecipitation applications. Arrays are offered as catalog designs or customizable designs, with no minimum order size and short delivery time, which differentiates us from other vendors and enables researchers the maximum flexibility in their studies.  Our end-to-end solution includes reagents for sample preparation and microarray processing; hardware for sample QC and high-throughput microarray scanning; microarrays on industry-standard 1” × 3” glass slides for key applications; custom microarray design services; and GeneSpring and CytoGenomics software products for data analysis.PCR and qPCR Instrumentation and Molecular Biology ReagentsPolymerase chain ceaction (“PCR”) is a standard laboratory method used to amplify the amount of genetic material of a given sample to enable further interrogation.  Quantitative PCR (“qPCR”) or real time PCR is also a standard method used in genomic research facilities to measure the amount of a specific nucleic acid sequence within a sample.  There are several applications for qPCR, among the most common are identifying the expression level of a specific gene, or calculating the amount of a specific pathogen present in a sample. Agilent offers a complete portfolio of PCR & qPCR instruments, as well as specialty enzymes for amplifying difficult sample types. In addition to PCR and qPCR enzymes, Agilent offers a wide range of molecular biology reagents including tools for cloning and mutagenesis applications.Nucleic Acid Solutions Our Nucleic Acid Solutions division (""NASD"") is a contract manufacturing and development services business with equipment and expertise focused on mid to large scale production of synthesized oligonucleotide APIs under pharmaceutical GMP conditions for an emerging class of drugs that utilize oligonucleotide molecules for disease therapy.  These drugs have advanced from single strand DNA molecules to complex, highly modified molecules including antisense, aptamers, double-stranded RNA, and RNA mixtures. These advancements in the technology have greatly improved the efficacy of delivery and stability of the oligos in-vivo. NASD offers industry leading experience to efficiently advance our customer’s oligo drug candidates from clinical trials to commercial launch with a common goal of patient health and safety.   8Table of Contents            Automated Electrophoresis and MicrofluidicsAutomated electrophoresis is a separation technique for bio molecules such as proteins, peptides and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) and is used to determine the identity of a molecule by either size or charge.

While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in 12Table of Contents            general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.Materials Our life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.EnvironmentalOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws.We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.Acquisition and Disposal of Material AssetsIn 2018, we acquired seven businesses, for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million.

Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;•innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;•appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;•manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;•price our products competitively;•anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and•control product quality in our manufacturing process.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures. General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:•reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;•increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increased price pressure for our products and services; and•greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.15Table of Contents            Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.   Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2018. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;•changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;•changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;•tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs recently enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain;•negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•differing protection of intellectual property;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and•geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.We sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from various countries.  Tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and 16Table of Contents            financial condition.  Further, additional tariffs which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business models, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to 17Table of Contents            certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us 18Table of Contents            to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting.  If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. 19Table of Contents            In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins, and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics 20Table of Contents            providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.Certain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contaminations.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.   Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or 21Table of Contents            could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.Our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. The 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations.  Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.  The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities.  The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we 22Table of Contents            may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019.  On June 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion.  As of October 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.Our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:•increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters, and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers 23Table of Contents            or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.As of October 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,247 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.We could incur significant liabilities if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters.  If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.   Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.

(""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.In 2018, we acquired seven businesses for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million. The largest of which was Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. (""AATI"") for approximately $268 million in cash. On November 14, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of ACEA Biosciences Inc. (""ACEA""), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million in cash. The financial results of ACEA will be included within our financial results from the date of the close. In 2017, we acquired two businesses for a combined purchase price of approximately $125 million in cash. Agilent's net revenue of $4,914 million in 2018 increased 10 percent when compared to 2017.

Net income was $316 million in 2018 compared to net income of $684 million and $462 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net income for the year ended October 31, 2018 was impacted by a  discrete tax charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act passed on December 22, 2017. See  Note 4, ""Income Taxes"" for more details.  As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,247 million and $2,678 million, respectively.  On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive 29Table of Contents            programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased 2 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016,  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018 we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time.   During the year ended October 31, 2018, cash dividends of $0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2017, cash dividends of $0.528 per share, or $170 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash dividends of $0.460 per share, or $150 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2018 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.164 per share of common stock, or approximately $52 million which will be paid on January 23, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2018. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Looking forward, we continue to focus on differentiating product solutions, improving our customers' experience and  growing our operating margin. In addition, we remain focused on a balanced capital allocation through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue in 2019 but we also anticipate the contribution from our recent acquisitions to partially offset the currency impact.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party 30Table of Contents            evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.Inventory Valuation.    We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation.    We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016. Shares granted under the Long-Term Performance Program based on Total Shareholders Return (""LTPP-TSR"") were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP based on Operating Margin (“LTPP-OM”) and LTPP based on Earnings per share (“LTPP-EPS”) is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period is set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. The probable shares to vest are estimated based on the forecasted OM and EPS at the time of the grant and updated every quarter with latest forecast and actual information. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date. All awards granted after 2015 to our senior management employees have a one year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model.Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2016, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For the 2017 and 2018 LTPP (TSR) grants and calculation of the post-vest discount using the Finnerty model, we used our own post-separation historical stock price volatility. See Note 3, ""Share-based Compensation,"" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions.    Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2018 and 2017, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2018, discount rates for the U.S. plans 31Table of Contents            increased compared to the previous year. For 2018 and 2017, the discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2018, slightly increased compared to the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in U.S. pension expense and $16 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on U.S. pension expense and $9 million on non-U.S. pension expense. For 2018, actual return on assets was below expectations which, along with contributions during the year, increased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in a decrease of the funded status at year end. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $3 million benefit in 2018, $15 million benefit in 2017 and $3 million expense in 2016. The years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, included a gain on curtailment and settlements of $5 million,  $32 million and $16 million, respectively.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2018, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development (""IPR&D"") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.32Table of Contents            Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on triggering events in the year ended October 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $4 million due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects.Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.  We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis.  If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October 31, 2018, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. and U.S state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act significantly changes the existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business.  ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date.   We have recognized the tax charge of $499 million due to transition tax liability and $53 million due to the impact of reduction in U.S. tax rates in the period when the tax law was enacted as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. We have completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Tax Act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) inclusions. See Note 4, ""Income Taxes"" for more details. These computations are based on the regulations and guidance already provided by federal and state tax authorities. The company will continue to assess the impact of the further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on its business and consolidated financial statements. Any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the adjustments are determined.33Table of Contents            Adoption of New PronouncementsSee Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements,"" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.Foreign CurrencyOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2018. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue it will also have a negative impact on our costs and expenses. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2017.   When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue it will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. Results from OperationsNet Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2018 over 2017% Change 2017 over 2016   % Change 2018 2017 2016  (in millions)    Net revenue:         Products$3,746 $3,397 $3,213 10% 6%Services and other$1,168 $1,075 $989 9% 9%Total net revenue$4,914 $4,472 $4,202 10% 6%  Years Ended October 31, 2018 over 2017ppts Change 2017 over 2016ppts Change 2018 2017 2016 % of total net revenue:         Products76% 76% 76% — —Services and other24% 24% 24% — —Total100% 100% 100%    Agilent's net revenue of $4,914 million in October 31, 2018 increased 10 percent when compared to 2017.

Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2018 reflects higher sales volume, favorable business mix, lower manufacturing material costs and lower amortization expense of intangible assets partially offset by increased wages and variable pay, an impairment of certain intangible assets and unfavorable currency movements. Total gross margin for the year ended October 31, 2017 increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year. Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2017 reflects higher sales volume, results from margin improvement initiatives, lower amortization expense of intangible assets and the impact of an employee pension settlement gain partially offset by higher wages and variable pay.Total operating margin was flat for the year ended October 31, 2018, when compared to last year. Operating margins was impacted by higher gross margins, lower acquisition and integration costs and lower amortization expense offset by increased wages and variable pay, an impairment of certain intangible assets, higher transformational initiative costs and the additional research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses related to our recent acquisitions. Total operating margin increased 4 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to 2016. Operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margins, the impact of lower amortization expense of intangible assets, lower transformation initiatives costs, lower acquisition and integration costs and the impact of an employee pension settlement gain when compared to 2016.Gross inventory charges were $26 million in 2018, $24 million in 2017 and  $20 million in 2016. Sales of previously written down inventory were $8 million in 2018, $9 million in 2017 and $9 million in 2016.  Research and development expenses increased 14 percent for the year ended October 31, 2018 when compared with last year. Research and development expenses increased due to increased program spending on new products related to all of our businesses in addition to higher wages and variable pay, unfavorable currency movements and additional expenses related to acquired businesses when compared to spending in 2017. Research and development expenses increased 3 percent for the year ended October 31, 2017 when compared with 2016. Research and development expenditures increased due to increased spending on new products related to all of our businesses, additional expenses related to increased headcount from acquisitions, and higher wages and variable pay.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increase was due to higher wages and variable pay, higher commissions, increased corporate costs, higher share-based compensation expense, higher transformational initiative costs, an impairment of certain intangible assets and unfavorable currency movements. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets, lower transformational initiatives, lower acquisition and integration costs, the impact of an employee pension settlement gain and reduced costs due to business improvement initiatives partially offset by higher wages and variable pay and additional selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our acquisitions in 2017. Interest expense for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $75 million, $79 million and $72 million, respectively, and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts. At October 31, 2018, our headcount was approximately 14,800 compared to 13,500 in 2017. 36Table of Contents            Other income (expense), netFor the year ended October 31, 2018, other income (expense), net includes the net gain of $20 million related to the step-up of our initial investment in Lasergen, $15 million of income related to a special one-time settlement with a third-party and income of $12 million related to the provision of site service costs to, and lease income from, Keysight Technologies, Inc.

Income Taxes Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Provision for income taxes$630 $119 $82For 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent.  For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) as discussed below.For 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.For 2016, the company’s income tax expense was $82 million with an effective tax rate of 15.1 percent. The income tax provision for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method investment impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027 see Note 19, ""Subsequent Events"" for more information. Other tax holidays are due for renewal between 2019 and 2020. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $87 million, $93 million, and $86 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.27, $0.29, and $0.26 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.The Tax Act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (""FDII""); (6) repealing domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.37Table of Contents            The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. Due to our fiscal year end, the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of 23 percent for our fiscal year ending October 31, 2018 and 21 percent for subsequent fiscal years.ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (""SAB 118"") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. For the year ended October  31, 2018, the company recognized income tax expense related to the Tax Act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate as described below.  As of October 31, 2018, the company has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Tax Act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on GILTI inclusions. Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (""Transition Tax""): The Transition Tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P"") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-U.S. taxes paid (Tax Pools) on such earnings. Historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 E&P outside the U.S. For the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. Since the Tax Act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition U.S. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. The resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the Tax Act. We have completed our accounting for charges related to the Transition Tax.Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate:  The reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. The amount recorded for the year ended October31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. We have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes. GILTI:  The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”).  Our analysis of the new GILTI rules and how they may impact us is incomplete. Accordingly, we have not made a policy election regarding the treatment of GILTI tax.Indefinite Reinvestment Assertion: Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.  The company repatriated $1,921 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018. The company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2018. The U.S. statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for the fiscal years 2014 expired in July 2018.  The statute expiration resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $23 million. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate 38Table of Contents            of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.Segment OverviewIn 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved the microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. Following this re-organization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. All historical financial segment information for both the life sciences and applied markets segment and the diagnostics and genomics segment has been recast to reflect this reorganization in our financial statements.Life Sciences and Applied MarketsOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level.

Foreign currency movements for 2018 had an overall favorable currency impact of 2 percentage points on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. Geographically, revenue increased 8 percent in the Americas with no currency impact, increased 12 percent in Europe with a 5 percentage point favorable currency impact and increased 8 percent in Asia Pacific with a 1 percentage point favorable currency impact. From a product standpoint liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and cell analysis systems led with double digit growth. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry and gas chromatography also posted strong results helped by growth in the chemical and energy markets.End market performance in 2018 was led by pharmaceutical markets which were strong throughout the year. Chemical and energy markets kept the momentum from 2017 and delivered strong growth. Academic and government and environmental markets also delivered strong growth. Food market contracted mainly driven by consolidations of governmental agencies in China.Life science and applied markets business revenue in 2017 increased 4 percent compared to 2016.  From a product standpoint, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, software and informatics systems, and cell analysis systems led with double digit growth during the year.  Gas chromatography returned to strong growth on the strength of rebounding chemical and energy markets.  Liquid chromatography grew single digits compared to 2016 as the pharmaceutical markets moderated.End market performance in 2017 showed a shift in growth trends from those of 2016.  Chemical and energy markets rebounded sharply from the depressed levels of 2016 and delivered strong growth.  The growth from pharmaceutical markets, which led the way in 2016, was modest reflecting difficult year on year comparisons.  Food and environmental markets demonstrated continued growth during the year.  Academic and government and diagnostic and clinical market sales saw improvement as the year progressed.39Table of Contents            Looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs. We anticipate strong sales funnels given new product introductions as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. While we anticipate volatility in our markets, we expect continued growth across most end markets.Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the life sciences and applied markets business' margins, expenses and income from operations for 2018 versus 2017, and 2017 versus 2016. Years Ended October 31, 2018 over 2017Change 2017 over 2016Change 2018 2017 2016 Total gross margin61.3% 60.2% 58.8% 1 ppt 1 pptOperating margin24.1% 22.5% 20.7% 2 ppts 2 ppts(in millions)         Research and development$219 $201 $191 9% 5%Selling, general and administrative$625 $585 $569 7% 3%Income from operations$547 $468 $412 17% 14%Gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2018 compared to 2017.  The increase was due to increased volume and lower manufacturing material costs.  Gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due to a combination of moderate price increases, margin improvement initiatives, and reduced logistics costs.Research and development expenses increased 9 percent in 2018 when compared to 2017.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and OtherWe have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 14, ""Commitments and Contingencies"", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many 46Table of Contents            locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2018 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsOperating leases$42 $58 $23 $57Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers412 2 — —Other purchase commitments80 — — —Retirement plans23 — — —Transitional pension contributions to our U.S. 401(k) plan$7 $15 $3 $—Total$564 $75 $26 $57Operating Leases.    Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see Note 14, ""Commitments and Contingencies"".Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.    We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, in the past we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2018, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than $1 million, $1 million as of October 31, 2017 and less than $1 million as of October 31, 2016. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other Purchase Commitments.    We have categorized ""other purchase commitments"" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under ""other purchase commitments"" were approximately $80 million within the next year. Approximately $27 million of the new contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 15 years.Retirement Plans.    Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2018 or October 31, 2017.47Table of Contents            On Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2018 balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsSenior notes$— $500 $1,000 $300Credit facility(1)— — — —Interest expense70 116 79 27Transition tax(2)34 68 68 256Total$104 $684 $1,147 $583(1)  The credit facility expires on September 15, 2019.(2)  The transition tax payable may be adjusted based on our 2018 tax return filings.Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017 include $607 million and $131 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities.  Of these amounts, $215 million and $131 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.  The remaining $392 million in other long-term liabilities relates to the one-time transition tax payable after fiscal year 2019. The transition tax is payable, beginning in fiscal year 2019 over eight years with 8 percent due in each of the first five years, 15 percent in year six, 20 percent in year seven and 25 percent in year eight. 48Table of Contents            ",">Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 53 percent of our revenue in 2018, 51 percent of our revenue in 2017 and 54 percent of our revenues in 2016 were generated in U.S. dollars.The favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has increased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2018. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter to the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.  We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.49Table of Contents            ",">Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements Page   Consolidated Financial Statements:  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 51Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 53Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 54Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2018 and 2017 55Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 56Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 57Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58Quarterly Summary (unaudited) 10250Table of Contents            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Agilent Technologies, Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule appearing under Item 15(a)(2). (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.51Table of Contents            Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP   San Jose, California December 20, 2018   We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999. 52Table of

Technologies, Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Basis of Presentation.    The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.Principles of Consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Revision of Services and Other, Product Net Revenue and related Cost of Sales.  In 2018, we identified a stream of service revenue that had been presented as product revenue in the prior years.  We have revised prior year's presentation to show the revenue within services and other to conform with the current presentation in fiscal 2018.   The cost of sales associated with these newly identified service revenue has also been revised to align with the new presentation. For the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 service and other revenue increased $13 million and $14 million, respectively, and service and other cost of sales increased $7 million in both periods, with corresponding reductions in product revenue and cost of sales.  These corrections to the classifications are not considered to be material to current or prior periods and had no impact to our results of operations previously reported in our consolidated statement of operations.Use of Estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes.Retirement of Treasury Shares.  Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital, based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings.  All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. Provisions for discounts, warranties, returns, extended payment terms, and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.Product Revenue.   Product revenue includes revenue generated from the sales of our analytical instrumentation, software and consumables.  Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of analytical instrumentation. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.58Table of Contents            Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and has been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.Service Revenue.  Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer and software support including, Software as a Service (SaaS), consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition, the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.  Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of measurement instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized upon delivery once title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Delivery of installation, start-up services and other services varies based on the complexity of the equipment, staffing levels in a geographic location and customer preferences, and can range from a few days to a few months. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules which require vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue in a multiple element arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.We have evaluated the deliverables in our multiple-element arrangements and concluded that they are separate units of accounting if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met.We use VSOE of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. VSOE of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. TPE of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. As our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish TPE. ESP represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by management. We may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. As these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in ESP. The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.For sales arrangements that include equipment lease along with other products or services, revenue is allocated to the different elements based on the Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements.  Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a capital (sales-type) lease using lease classification guidance.Deferred Revenue.    Deferred revenue represents the amount that is allocated to undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements. We limit the revenue recognized to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or meeting other specified performance conditions.Accounts Receivable, net.    Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable 59Table of Contents            credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.Shipping and Handling Costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.Inventory.    Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In May 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved our microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. As a result, we reassigned approximately $45 million of goodwill from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics segment using the relative fair value allocation approach.  Goodwill balances as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, have been recast to conform to this new presentation. In fiscal year 2018, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development (""IPR&D"") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater 60Table of Contents            than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2018. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on triggering events in the year ended October 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of $4 million due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects. Share-Based Compensation.    For the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program (""LTPP"") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting.  Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $71 million in 2018, $61 million in 2017 and $60 million in 2016. See Note 3, ""Share-based Compensation"" for additional information.Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans.   Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans.  Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.   Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually.   See Note 12, “Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans” for additional information. Taxes on Income.    Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 4, ""Income Taxes"" for more information.Warranty.    Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 13, ""Guarantees"".Advertising.    Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $41 million in 2018, $38 million in 2017 and $30 million in 2016.Research and Development.    Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Sales Taxes.    Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.Net Income Per Share.    Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 5, ""Net Income Per Share"".Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments.  We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.As of October 31, 2018, approximately $1,361 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. In 2018, we repatriated $1,921 million  of the cash held outside the U.S. The cash remaining outside the U.S. can be repatriated to the U.S. as local working capital and other regulatory conditions permit. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""), our cash and cash equivalents are no longer subjected to U.S. federal tax on repatriation into the U.S. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short term deposits held at major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.61Table of Contents            We classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Currently, we have no short-term investments.Variable Interest Entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).  The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We account for these investments under either the equity or cost method, depending on the circumstances.  We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. During 2016, we wrote down an equity method investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $18 million.  In addition, we recorded an impairment of $7 million of uncollectible loans related to this equity method investment.During the year ended October 31, 2016, Agilent made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen for $80 million.  This investment in Lasergen was accounted for under the cost method.  Agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and included an option to acquire the remaining shares until March 2018. During the year ended October 31, 2018, we exercised our option and acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen, Inc. that we did not already own for an additional cash consideration of approximately  $107 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income.  Lasergen was previously considered a VIE. As of October 31, 2018, we have no VIE's.Investments. Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method, their carrying value approximates their estimated fair value. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of October 31, 2018 or 2017 . The fair value of our senior notes, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy is lower than the carrying value by approximately $15 million as of October 31, 2018 and exceeds the carrying value by approximately $58 million  as of October 31, 2017. The change in the fair value over carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased market interest rates.  The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 10, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.Concentration of Credit Risk.    Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.  Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of combined accounts receivable as of October 31, 2018, or 2017.Derivative Instruments.    Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options and, in the past, interest rate swaps to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 62Table of Contents            rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months and interest rate swaps, if any, mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedges, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was not material.  Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.Property, Plant and Equipment.    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.Leases.    We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one year to twenty years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to six years. In addition, we lease equipment to customers in connection with our diagnostics business using both capital and operating leases. As of October 31, 2018 and 2017 our diagnostics and genomics segment has approximately $32 million and $27 million, respectively, of lease receivables related to capital leases and approximately $20 million and $22 million, respectively, of net assets for operating leases.  We depreciate the assets related to the operating leases over their estimated useful lives, typically five years.Capitalized Software.    We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years once development is complete.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.Employee Compensation and Benefits.    Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $107 million and $101 million as of October 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.Foreign Currency Translation.    We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates 63Table of Contents            which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and was $3 million loss for 2018, $2 million loss for 2017 and $5 million loss for 2016, respectively. 2.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contract with customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The objective of the new revenue standard is to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The guidance is effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 2019. We will adopt this standard on November 1, 2018 through application of the modified retrospective method reflecting the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance to revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Under the new guidance, there are specific criteria to determine if a performance obligation should be recognized over time or at a point in time. We expect that in some cases the revenue recognition timing under the new guidance will change from current practice.  We have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of the new guidance in 2018. While the timing of revenue recognition for some of the company’s sales transactions will be affected by the new guidance, the impact is not expected to be material. The cumulative impact to beginning retained earnings from adopting the new revenue standard is expected to be a credit of less than $30 million. In January 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The provisions under this amendment are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the new guidance on our financial statements and consider that the most notable impact upon the adoption of the new standard will be the recognition of a material right-of-use asset and lease liability for our real estate and automobile leases.In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  We do not expect the impact of the amendments to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. There is no material impact expected to our cumulative retained earnings on adoption of these amendments.  In November 2016, the FASB issued amendments to require amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  We do not expect the impact of the amendments to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.  In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business in connection with business combinations with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted 64Table of Contents            for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.  This guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Adjustments will be recorded in the period that they are determined rather than applied retrospectively via revision to the period of acquisition and each period thereafter.   We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amendment also simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  We do not expect to early adopt nor do we expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. This guidance also specifies that only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. The standard requires employers to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and to report the other components of net periodic benefit costs (which include interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credits and actuarial gains and losses) separately and below operating income in the statement of operations. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.  We expect the adoption of this guidance to result in an impact of approximately $20 million of income reclassified from our income from operations to other income (expense) on our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year 2019. In future filings, we will revise our prior periods to conform to the new presentation required under this guidance.In May 2017, the FASB issued an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting intended to better align a company's risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and presentation of hedge results.  The amendments expand and refine accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and hedged item in the financial statements.   The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2019, including the interim periods within those annual periods.  We expect to early adopt this guidance beginning November 1, 2018.  We do not expect the the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In February 2018, the FASB issued amendments to reporting comprehensive income to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017 that reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and made other changes to U.S. federal tax laws.  The amendments in this update also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects.   The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2019, and for interim periods within that fiscal year and should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. We expect to adopt this guidance on November 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures upon adoption.In February 2018, the FASB issued technical corrections and improvements to amendments published in January 2016 to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The provisions under these corrections and improvements are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is not permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.65Table of Contents            In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement which eliminates certain disclosure requirements and modifies others. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020, and for interim periods within that year with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2018, the FASB issued updates to improve the effectiveness of disclosures for defined benefit plans under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 715-20. The amendments in this guidance remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosures, and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Description of Share-Based PlansEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.    Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. Currently, there are 75 million shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP.Under our ESPP, employees purchased 558,116 shares for $32 million in 2018, 618,270 shares for $26 million in 2017 and 696,178 shares for $23 million in 2016. As of October 31, 2018, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 26,937,115. This excludes the number of shares of common stock to be issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participants contributions totaling $17 million as of October 31, 2018.Incentive Compensation Plans.    On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the ""2018 Plan"") which amends, including renaming and extending the term of, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the ""2009 Plan"").  The 2009 plan replaced the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (""SARs""), restricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2018 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2018, 6,158,260 shares were available for future awards under the 2018 Stock Plan.Stock options under the 2018 Stock Plan may be either ""incentive stock options"", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options were granted prior to November 1, 2015 and generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. Agilent issues new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program administered under the 2018 Stock Plan, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets over the three-year period are met.   The performance target for grants made in 2016  were based on Operating 66Table of Contents            Margin (“OM”) and the performance grants made in 2017 and 2018 were based on Earnings Per Share (""EPS""). In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period are set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period are set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Based on the performance metrics the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years and the maximum award value for awards granted in 2017 and 2016 cannot exceed 300 percent of the grant date target value. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met.We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Impact of Share-based Compensation AwardsWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Cost of products and services$16 $15 $14Research and development7 6 6Selling, general and administrative48 40 40Total share-based compensation expense$71 $61 $60At October 31, 2018 and 2017 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory. Valuation AssumptionsFor all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date.The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and as appropriate, a discount related to the one-year post vesting. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of awards granted. Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016LTPP:     Volatility of Agilent shares21% 23% 24%Volatility of selected peer-company shares14%-66% 15%-63% 14%-50%Pair-wise correlation with selected peers32% 36% 35%      Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards4.8% 5.3% 5.5%67Table of Contents            Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulations model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the LTPP (TSR) grants in 2016, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2017 and thereafter, we used our own historical stock price volatility.           All LTPP awards granted to our executives have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares.

For the year ended October 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) as discussed below.For 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent. Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 70Table of Contents            2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.For 2016, the company’s income tax expense was $82 million with an effective tax rate of 15.1 percent. The income tax provision for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized.The company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027, see Note 19, ""Subsequent Events"" for more information. Other tax holidays are due for renewal 2019 and 2020. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $87 million, $93 million, and $86 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.27, $0.29, and $0.26 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.2017 U.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law.  The Tax Act enacted significant changes affecting our fiscal year 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and (2) imposing a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.The Tax Act also establishes new tax provisions affecting our fiscal year 2019, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (""FDII""); (6) repealing domestic production activity deduction; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation.The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. Due to our fiscal year end, the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of 23 percent for our fiscal year ending October 31, 2018 and 21 percent for subsequent fiscal years.ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (""SAB 118"") which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. For the year ended October 31, 2018, the company recognized  income tax expense related to the Tax Act of $552 million which includes (1) an expense of $499 million of U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased U.S. corporate tax rate as described below.  As of October 31, 2018, the company has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Tax Act except for the policy election for the treatment of the tax on GILTI inclusions. Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (""Transition Tax""): The Transition Tax is based on the company’s total unrepatriated post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P"") of its foreign subsidiaries and the amount of non-U.S. taxes paid (Tax Pools) on such earnings. Historically, the company permanently reinvested a significant portion of these post-1986 E&P outside the U.S. For the remaining portion, the company previously accrued deferred taxes. Since the Tax Act required all foreign earnings to be taxed currently, the company recorded an income tax expense of $651 million for its one-time transition U.S. federal tax and a benefit of $152 million for the reversal of related deferred tax liabilities. The resulting $499 million net transition tax, reduced by existing tax credits, will be paid over 8 years in accordance with the election available under the Tax Act. We have completed our accounting for charges related to the Transition Tax.Reduction of U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate:  The reduction of the corporate income tax rate requires companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. The amount recorded for the year ended October31, 2018 for the remeasurement due to tax rate change is $53 million. We have completed our accounting for the measurement of deferred taxes. GILTI:  The Tax Act subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI.  U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (1) treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in the U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense 71Table of Contents            when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”).  Our analysis of the new GILTI rules and how they may impact us is incomplete. Accordingly, we have not made a policy election regarding the treatment of GILTI tax.Indefinite Reinvestment Assertion: Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the company had indefinite investment assertion on a significant portion of its undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we have reevaluated our historic assertion and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.  The company repatriated $1,921 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018. The company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $11 million for foreign withholding taxes on repatriation of remaining undistributed earnings.The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: October 31, 2018 2017 DeferredTax Assets Deferred TaxLiabilities DeferredTax Assets Deferred TaxLiabilities (in millions)Inventory$7 $— $16 $—Intangibles— 112 — 93Property, plant and equipment8 — 12 —Warranty reserves8 — 12 —Pension benefits and retiree medical benefits49 — 70 —Employee benefits, other than retirement34 — 28 —Net operating loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards185 — 328 —Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries— 18 — 163Share-based compensation31 — 45 —Deferred revenue38 — 45 —Other4 3 1 —Subtotal364 133 557 256Tax valuation allowance(135) — (138) —Total deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities$229 $133 $419 $256The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 for the deferred tax asset and liabilities was primarily due to the Tax Act. Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2018, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $135 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is mainly related to deferred tax assets for California R&D credits, net operating losses in the state of Colorado and the Netherlands and capital losses in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.At October 31, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $21 million, $671 million and $330 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019. If not utilized, $140 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019. The remaining $190 million of the foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2018, we had federal and foreign capital loss carryforwards of $48 million and $119 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2022. The foreign capital losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2018, we had state tax credit carryforwards, net of reserves of approximately $41 million. The state tax credits carry forward indefinitely. 72Table of Contents            The breakdown between long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows: October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Long-term deferred tax assets (included within other assets)$165 $240Long-term deferred tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(69) (77)Total$96 $163The breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows: October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Current income tax assets (included within other current assets)$59 $77Long-term income tax assets (included within other assets)19 18Current income tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities)(71) (55)Long-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(607) (131)Total$(600) $(91)The aggregate changes in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Balance, beginning of year$224 $293 $289Additions for tax positions related to the current year27 32 31Additions for tax positions from prior years2 1 1Reductions for tax positions from prior years(13) (3) (27)Settlements with taxing authorities— (52) —Statute of limitations expirations(26) (47) (1)Balance, end of year$214 $224 $293As of October 31, 2018, we had $214 million of unrecognized tax benefits of which $190 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a tax expense of $11 million, a tax benefit of $9 million and a tax expense of $2 million of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 were $27 million and $16 million, respectively.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2015 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2018. The U.S. statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for fiscal year 2014 expired in July 2018.  The statute expiration resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $23 million. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.73Table of Contents            5.     NET INCOME PER SHAREThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below.  Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Numerator:     Net income$316 $684 $462Denominators:     Basic weighted average shares321 322 $326Potential common shares — stock options and other employee stock plans4 4 3Diluted weighted average shares325 326 329The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued approximately 2 million, 3 million and 3 million, of share-based awards, respectively.  For the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, options to purchase 36,200 shares, 200 shares and 1.1 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.6.     INVENTORY October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Finished goods$386 $363Purchased parts and fabricated assemblies252 212Inventory$638 $575Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges, included in continuing operations, of $26 million were recorded in total cost of products in 2018, $24 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016, respectively.

As a result, we reassigned approximately $45 million of goodwill from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our diagnostics and genomics segment using the relative fair value allocation approach.  Goodwill balances as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, have been recast to conform to this new presentation.As of September 30, 2018, we assessed goodwill impairment for our reporting units and no impairment was indicated.75Table of Contents            The component parts of other intangible assets at October 31, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the table below: Other Intangible Assets GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortizationand Impairments Net BookValue (in millions)As of October 31, 2017:     Purchased technology$855 $646 $209Trademark/Tradename149 73 76Customer relationships151 112 39Third-party technology and licenses$27 $14 $13Total amortizable intangible assets$1,182 $845 $337In-Process R&D24 — 24Total$1,206 $845 $361As of October 31, 2018:     Purchased technology$947 $683 $264Trademark/Tradename151 88 63Customer relationships107 63 44Third-party technology and licenses$28 $19 $9Total amortizable intangible assets$1,233 $853 $380In-Process R&D111 — 111Total$1,344 $853 $491      In 2018, we acquired seven businesses, for a combined purchase price of approximately $536 million. The largest of which was Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. (""AATI"") for approximately $268 million in cash.  The financial results of all these businesses have been included in our financial results from the date of the business’ respective close. We have not included the pro forma impact of these acquisitions since they are not material individually or in aggregate to our current or prior period results. During  2018, we recorded additions to goodwill of $381 million and to other intangible assets of $262 million related to the acquisition of these businesses. During 2018, other intangible assets, net decreased $1 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. During 2017, we recorded additions to goodwill of $78 million and to intangible assets of $52 million related to the acquisition of  two businesses. During the year other intangible assets decreased $5 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. During 2018, we also wrote-off the gross carrying amount of $89 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets which were no longer being used.In general, for United States federal tax purposes, goodwill from asset purchases is deductible, however any goodwill created as part of a stock acquisition is not deductible.During 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.  In 2017, there were no impairments of other intangible assets recorded.  In 2016, we recorded impairments of other intangibles related to the cancellation of in-process research and development projects of $4 million.Amortization expense of intangible assets was $110 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017, and $154 million in 2016. 76Table of Contents            Future amortization expense related to existing finite-lived purchased intangible assets associated with business combinations for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is estimated below:Estimated future amortization expense:  (in millions)2019$942020$792021$652022$512023$41Thereafter$509.   INVESTMENTSThe following table summarizes the company's equity investments as of October 31, 2018 and 2017 (net book value): October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Long-Term   Cost method investments$38 $106Trading securities30 32Total$68 $138During 2018, we acquired all of the remaining shares of Lasergen, Inc. (Lasergen), for an additional cash consideration of approximately $107 million, an investment that was accounted for under the cost method in 2017 for approximately $80 million. The fair value remeasurement of our previous investment immediately before the acquisition resulted in a net gain of $20 million and was recorded in other income. Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and a fund and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. During the year ended October 31, 2016, we identified certain events and circumstances that indicated the decline in value of an equity method investment was other-than-temporary.  As a result, we wrote down the investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of approximately $18 million.Amounts included in other income (expense), net for the appropriate share of loss on equity method investments and other than temporary impairments were as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Equity method investments - share of losses$— $— $(10)Equity method investments - other than temporary impairments — — (18)Total$— $— $(28)Net unrealized gains on our trading securities portfolio were $1 million in 2018, $4 million in 2017 and $1 million in 2016.10.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value 77Table of Contents            measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.Fair Value HierarchyThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2018 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement                                                                 at October 31, 2018 Using October 31, 2018 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,355 $1,355 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)16 — 16 —Long-term       Trading securities30 30 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,401 $1,385 $16 $—Liabilities:       Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$5 $— $5 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability30 — 30 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$35 $— $35 $—78Table of Contents            Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2017 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement                                                                    at October 31, 2017 Using October 31, 2017 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,659 $1,659 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)4 — 4 —Long-term       Trading securities32 32 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,695 $1,691 $4 $—Liabilities:      Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$6 $— $6 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability32 — 32 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$38 $— $38 $—Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable.Trading securities, which is comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisLong-Lived AssetsFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Years EndedOctober 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Long-lived assets held and used$21 $— $4Long-lived assets held for sale$— $— $—For 2018,  long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $21 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $21 million, which was included in net income. The impairment charge in 2018 of  $21 million relates to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment  that were deemed unrecoverable. For 2017, there were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used. For 2016, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $4 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $4 million, which was 79Table of Contents            included in net income.  The impairment charge in 2016 of $4 million relates to IPR&D projects that were abandoned and written down to their fair value of zero. There were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets during 2018 and 2016 were measured using level 3 and 2 inputs respectively. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets in 2018, we used the income approach based on projected discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets over the remaining useful life.11.   DERIVATIVESWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options, and interest rate swaps, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.Fair Value HedgesWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. The fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and, in the past, we have used interest rate swaps to change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short term investments. As of October 31, 2018, all interest rate swap contracts had either been terminated or had expired. On August 9, 2011, we terminated five interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The remaining gain to be amortized at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. All deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective senior notes.  Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. Changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) each period. The changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to other income (expense) in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) over the life of the option contract.  For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, ineffectiveness and gains and losses recognized in other income (expense) due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012.  We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2018 was $1 million. In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the 80Table of Contents            authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. Other HedgesAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2018, was not material. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2018.There were 158 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2018 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 171 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2018 not designated as hedging instruments.

Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the ""RP""), defined benefits which are based on an employee's base or target pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plans is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the ""DPSP""), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. Effective November 1, 2014, Agilent’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan is closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires. As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen.  See Plan Amendments below.82Table of Contents            As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $141 million and $156 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.In addition to the DPSP, in the U.S., Agilent maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""SBRP""), supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the ""U.S. Plans"" in the tables below.Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements.401(k) Defined Contribution Plan.    Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan.  Effective April 30, 2016, we began matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation.  Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen.  The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $37 million in 2018, $33 million in 2017 and $24 million in 2016.Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Plans.    In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. Eligible retirees who were less than age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for a fixed amount which can be utilized to pay for either sponsored plans and/or individual medicare plans. Effective January 1, 2012, employees who were at least age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for fixed dollar subsidies and stipends. Grandfathered retirees receive a fixed monthly subsidy toward pre-65 premium costs (subsidy capped at 2011 levels) and a fixed monthly stipend post-65. The subsidy amounts will not increase. In addition, any new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the retiree medical plans upon retiring.  As of April 30, 2016, benefits under this plan were changed - see Plan Amendments below.Plan Amendments. In 2016, we made changes to our U.S. Retirement Plan and Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""U.S. Plans"").  Effective April 30, 2016, benefit accruals under the U.S. Plans were frozen.  Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there were no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016.  In addition, active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service - as of April 30, 2016 - will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement.Due to these plan amendments, we recorded a curtailment gain of $15 million in the U.S. Plans during the year ended October 31, 2016. In addition, we recognized a settlement gain of $1 million related to the U.S. Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan during the year ended October 31, 2016.Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law. In Japan, Agilent has employees' pension fund plans, which are defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law (JWPIL). The plans are composed of (a) a substitutional portion based on the pay-related part of the old-age pension benefits prescribed by JWPIL (similar to social security benefits in the United States) and (b) a corporate portion based on a contributory defined benefit pension arrangement established at the discretion of the company. During the year ended October 31, 2017, Agilent received government approval and returned the substitutional portion of Japan's pension plan to the Japanese government, as allowed by the JWPIL. The initial transfer resulted in a net gain of $32 million recorded within cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The net gain consisted of two parts - a gain of $41 million, representing the difference between the fair values of the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) settled of $65 million and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan of $24 million, offset by a settlement loss of $9 million related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, after the Japanese government’s final review of our initial payment, we received a refund of  $5 million which was recorded as a settlement gain.83Table of Contents            Components of Net periodic cost.    The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. For the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of:  Pensions U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans                    2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)                 Service cost — benefits earned during the period$— $— $12 $20 $19 $19 $1 $1 $1Interest cost on benefit obligation16 15 16 13 12 16 3 3 4Expected return on plan assets(28) (25) (25) (46) (41) (44) (7) (7) (7)Amortization of net actuarial loss1 3 3 29 36 27 8 11 10Amortization of prior service benefit— — (3) — — — (8) (9) (10)Total periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(11) $(7) $3 $16 $26 $18 $(3) $(1) $(2)Curtailments and settlements$— $— $(16) $(5) $(32) $— $— $— $—Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss                 Net actuarial (gain) loss$2 $(19) $22 $49 $(128) $149 $(2) $(9) $3Amortization of net actuarial loss(1) (3) (3) (29) (36) (27) (8) (11) (10)Prior service cost (benefit)— — 15 — — — — — (7)Amortization of prior service benefit— — 3 — — — 8 9 10Gain due to settlement— — — — 32 — — — —Foreign currency— — — 1 2 (3) — — —Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss$1 $(22) $37 $21 $(130) $119 $(2) $(11) $(4)Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss$(10) $(29) $24 $32 $(136) $137 $(5) $(12) $(6)84Table of Contents            Funded Status.    As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S.Post-RetirementBenefit Plans 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in millions)Change in fair value of plan assets:           Fair value — beginning of year$414 $341 $855 $774 $95 $88Actual return on plan assets8 66 (9) 81 1 14Employer contributions— 25 21 21 — —Participants' contributions— — — — — —Benefits paid(21) (18) (26) (23) (6) (7)Settlements— — 5 (26) — —Currency impact— — (21) 28 — —Fair value — end of year$401 $414 $825 $855 $90 $95Change in benefit obligation:           Benefit obligation — beginning of year$445 $434 $935 $1,002 $97 $103Service cost— — 20 19 1 1Interest cost16 15 13 12 3 3Participants' contributions— — — — — —Plan amendment— — 1 (1) — —Actuarial (gain) loss(19) 15 (6) (43) (7) (3)Benefits paid(22) (19) (27) (22) (7) (7)Curtailments— — — — — —Settlements— — — (70) — —Currency impact— — (23) 38 — —Benefit obligation — end of year$420 $445 $913 $935 $87 $97Overfunded (underfunded) status of PBO$(19) $(31) $(88) $(80) $3 $(2)Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:           Other assets$— $— $95 $86 $3 $—Employee compensation and benefits(1) (1) — — — —Retirement and post-retirement benefits(18) (30) (183) (166) — (2)Total net asset (liability)$(19) $(31) $(88) $(80) $3 $(2)Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss):           Actuarial (gains) losses$65 $65 $263 $243 $10 $20Prior service costs (benefits)— — — (1) (20) (28)Total$65 $65 $263 $242 $(10) $(8)The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized by Agilent as components of net expense during 2019 are as follows: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit)$— $— $(8)Amortization of actuarial net loss (gain)$1 $35 $485Table of Contents            Investment Policies and Strategies as of October 31, 2018 and 2017. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 3 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 31 to 60 percent to equities, from 38 to 61 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate investments and from zero to 12 percent to cash, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2018 and 2017 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as the practical expedient.   In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund.Fair Value.    The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 10, ""Fair Value Measurements"".Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments.Equity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock that are not traded on an active market are valued at quoted prices reported by investment dealers based on the underlying terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Other Investments - Other investments also includes partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3.Agilent has adopted the accounting guidance related to the presentation of certain investments using the NAV practical expedient. The accounting guidance exempts investments using this practical expedient from categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 86Table of Contents            The following tables present the fair

fiscal year 2019, we  do not expect to contribute to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the  Post-Retirement Medical Plans.  We expect to contribute $23 million to plans outside the U.S.  The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)2019$29 $23 $82020$31 $25 $82021$30 $28 $82022$29 $31 $72023$30 $33 $72024 - 2028$142 $175 $33Assumptions.    The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2018 and 2017, were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally 90Table of Contents            based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate3.75% 3.75% 4.20%Average increase in compensation levelsn/a n/a 3.50%Expected long-term return on assets7.00% 7.25% 7.50%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate0.67-2.52% 0.22-2.66% 0.77-3.76%Average increase in compensation levels2.00-3.25% 2.00-4.25% 2.25-4.00%Expected long-term return on assets4.00-6.00% 4.00-6.25% 4.25-6.50%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:     Discount rate3.50% 3.50% 4.00%Expected long-term return on assets7.00% 7.25% 7.50%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 6.00% 7.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029 2029Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: As of the Years Ending October 31, 2018 2017U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate4.50% 3.75%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate0.83-2.68% 0.67-2.52%Average increase in compensation levels2.25-3.25% 2.00-3.25%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:   Discount rate4.25% 3.50%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 6.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029Health care trend rates do not have a significant effect on the total service and interest cost components or on the post-retirement benefit obligation amounts reported for the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan for the year ended October 31, 2018.13.   GUARANTEESStandard WarrantyWe accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend to one years from the date of delivery, depending on the product.91Table of Contents            A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities. October 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Balance as of October 31, 2017 and 2016$34 $35Accruals for warranties including change in estimates53 53Settlements made during the period(52) (54)Balance as of October 31, 2018 and 2017$35 $34Accruals for warranties due within one year35 33Accruals for warranties due after one year— 1Balance as of October 31, 2018 and 2017$35 $34Indemnifications in Connection with TransactionsIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future.  These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2018.  Indemnifications to Officers and DirectorsOur corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2018.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2018.In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2018.92Table of Contents            14.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOperating Lease Commitments:    We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases.  Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense was $64 million in 2018, $57 million in 2017 and $61 million in 2016.Future minimum lease payments and future minimum lease income under operating leases at October 31, 2018:  Future Minimum Lease Payments Future Minimum Lease Income  (in millions)2019 $42 $92020 $35 $82021 $23 $92022 $13 $42023 $10 $—Thereafter $57 $—Other Purchase Commitments.   Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled were approximately $80 million. Approximately $27 million of the penalties for the new contracts will reduce over the next 15 years.Contingencies:    We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, commercial, real estate, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.15.   SHORT-TERM DEBTCredit FacilitiesOn September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of October 31, 2018, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. 2017 Senior Notes                                               In October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2017 senior notes""). On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes.  The 2017 senior notes were repayable within one year as of October 31, 2017 and were reclassified to short-term debt. The remaining $100 million in senior notes matured and were paid in full on November 1, 2017. 93Table of Contents            16.   LONG-TERM DEBTSenior NotesThe following table summarizes the company's long-term senior notes and the related interest rate swaps: October 31, 2018 October 31, 2017 AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total (in millions)2020 Senior Notes$499 $7 $506 $499 $11 $5102022 Senior Notes399 — 399 398 — 3982023 Senior Notes597 — 597 596 — 5962026 Senior Notes297 — 297 297 — 297Total$1,792 $7 $1,799 $1,790 $11 $1,8012020 Senior NotesIn July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2020 senior notes""). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commenced on January 15, 2011.On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.2022 Senior NotesIn September 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes (""2022 senior notes""). The 2022 senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year, payments commenced on April 1, 2013.In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2018 was $1 million. 2023 Senior NotesIn June 2013, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2023 senior notes"").

The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year and payments commenced January 15, 2014.  2026 Senior NotesOn September 15, 2016, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $300 million in senior notes (""2026 senior notes""). The 2026 senior notes were issued at 99.624%% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 22, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.050% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 22nd and September 22nd of each year and payments commenced March 22, 2017.  94Table of Contents            In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2018 was $7 million. 17.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYStock Repurchase Program On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased 2 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016,  upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2018 we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on November 1, 2018.On November 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2019 repurchase program"") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time.  Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock During the year ended October 31, 2018, cash dividends of $0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2017, cash dividends of $0.528 per share, or $170 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash dividends of $0.460 per share, or $150 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 14, 2018 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.164 per share of common stock, or approximately $52 million which will be paid on January 23, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2018.

We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.In 2018, we re-organized our operating segments and moved our microfluidics business from our life sciences and applied markets operating segment to our diagnostics and genomics operating segment. Following this re-organization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. All historical financial segment information for both the life sciences and applied markets segment and the diagnostics and genomics segment has been recast to reflect this reorganization in our financial statements.97Table of Contents            A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (""ICP-OES"") instruments; raman spectroscopy, cell analysis plate based assays, flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer, laboratory software for sample tracking, information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients (""APIs"") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (""NGS"") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. This business also includes solutions that enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (""GMP"") conditions for use as API in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Third, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings for cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), in situ hybridization (“ISH”), hematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) staining and special staining. Fourth, we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Fifth, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. Finally, our biomolecular analysis business provides complete workflow solutions, including instruments, consumables and software, for quality control analysis of nucleic acid samples.  Samples are analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure accuracy in further genomics analysis techniques utilized in clinical and life science research applications. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.  Most of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices.  Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab.  Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies.  Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity.  Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements.A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, tax, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, order administration, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, pension curtailment or settlement gains, restructuring and transformational initiatives expenses, acquisition and integration costs, business exit and divestiture costs, special compliance costs, some nucleic acid solutions division (""NASD) site costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments.Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, in-sourcing or outsourcing of activities.The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.98Table of Contents            The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, transformational initiatives, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab TotalSegments (in millions)Year ended October 31, 2018:       Total net revenue$2,270 $943 $1,701 $4,914Income from operations$547 $178 $397 $1,122Depreciation expense$38 $33 $31 $102Share-based compensation expense$33 $14 $24 $71Year ended October 31, 2017:       Total net revenue$2,081 $860 $1,531 $4,472Income from operations$468 $168 $338 $974Depreciation expense$35 $30 $29 $94Share-based compensation expense$30 $10 $21 $61Year ended October 31, 2016:       Total net revenue$1,992 $790 $1,420 $4,202Income from operations$412 $131 $316 $859Depreciation expense$36 $31 $28 $95Share-based compensation expense$29 $10 $21 $60The following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Total reportable segments' income from operations$1,122 $974 $859Amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations(105) (117) (152)Acquisition and integration costs(23) (30) (41)Transformational initiatives(25) (12) (38)Asset Impairments(21) — (4)Business exit and divestiture costs ( primarily our NMR business)(9) — (11)Impairment of loans— — (7)NASD site costs(8) — —Pension curtailment gain— — 15Pension settlement gain5 32 1Special compliance costs(4) — —Other(4) (6) (7)Interest Income38 22 11Interest Expense(75) (79) (72)Other income (expense), net55 19 (10)Income before taxes, as reported$946 $803 $544Major Customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.99Table of Contents            The following table reflects segment assets and capital expenditures under our management reporting system.

Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based on where we ship the products or provide the services.Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 46 percent in fiscal year 2017 and 44 percent in fiscal year 2016. Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 19, ""Segment Information"", to our consolidated financial statements.Acquisition and Disposal of Material AssetsOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one comprising of the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that retained the Agilent name, and the other one that comprised of the electronic measurement business that was renamed Keysight Technologies, Inc. (“Keysight”). Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013. On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014.

Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;•innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;•appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;•manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;•price our products competitively;•anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and•control product quality in our manufacturing process.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or providing drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures. General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:•reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;•increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increased price pressure for our products and services; and•greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.15Table of Contents            Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.   Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, spending priorities, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 1 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2017. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;•changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•differing protection of intellectual property;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and•geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.We centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.16Table of Contents            In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.Our strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.Integrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business models, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodologies and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.Even if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses 17Table of Contents            may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business.  We must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  18Table of Contents            These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting.  If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.19Table of Contents            The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins, and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Environmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.Certain properties we have previously owned are undergoing remediation for subsurface contaminations.  Although we are indemnified for any liability relating to the required remediation, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  Further, other properties we have previously owned or facilities we have operated in the past, may be contaminated based on our operations.  In some cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for any liabilities related to such contamination, including companies that we used to be affiliated with such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if such environmental contamination is found to exist.  In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have 20Table of Contents            assumed the costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.  Our current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.   Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.Our pending patent copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.21Table of Contents            We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.We have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although the cash generated in the United States from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019.  On June 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion.  As of October 31, 2017, we had $110 million outstanding under the credit facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.Our incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:22Table of Contents            •increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters, laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.As of October 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,678 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.23Table of Contents            We could incur significant liability if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters.  If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.   Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.",>Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.,">Item 2.

(""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.On January 20, 2017, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the stock of Multiplicom NV (“Multiplicom”), a leading European diagnostics company with state-of-the-art genetic testing technology and products, for approximately $72 million in cash. Multiplicom, headquartered in Belgium, develops, manufactures and commercializes molecular diagnostic assays, provided as kits, which enable personalized medicine. The financial results of Multiplicom have been included within Agilent's from the date of the transaction.On July 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems (“Cobalt”) for approximately $53 million in cash. Cobalt, based in Oxfordshire, U.K., is a provider of differentiated Raman spectroscopic instruments for the pharmaceutical industry, applied markets and public safety. Cobalt's suite of benchtop and handheld/portable Raman spectroscopic instruments are based on proprietary technologies that enable through-barrier identification of chemicals and materials. The financial results of Cobalt have been included within Agilent's from the date of the transaction.In fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience (""Seahorse"") for $242 million and  iLab Solutions LLC (""iLab"") for $26 million. The financial results of Seahorse and iLab have been included within Agilent's from the date of the transaction. On March 2, 2016, we also made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen for $80 million. Lasergen is a Variable Interest Entity (""VIE""), however, we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance.  Because of the nature of the preferred stock of Lasergen that we own, we account for this investment under the cost method.Agilent's net revenue of $4,472 million in 2017 increased 6 percent when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements for 2017 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2016. Agilent's net revenue of $4,202 million increased 4 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 5 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016.  For the year ended October 31, 2017, our performance within the life sciences markets was led by solid growth in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets.  Within the applied markets, there was strong growth in the chemical and energy, food and environmental markets. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 1 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. For the year ended October 31, 2016 and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, acquisitions and the NMR business our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.  Within the applied markets, and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the NMR business for 2016  29Table of Contents            when compared to 2015, there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets, but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 9 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had no overall currency impact on revenue growth in 2017 when compared to 2016. For the year ended October 31, 2017, our performance within the clinical and diagnostics market continued to improve with strong revenue growth from our companion diagnostics and pathology businesses. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research markets continued to be strong, led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended October 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year. Revenue generated by Agilent CrossLab increased 8 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016.  Revenue grew across all key end markets led by strong growth in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical, chemical and energy and food markets. Revenue generated by Agilent CrossLab increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, there was growth in sales to all key markets.  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets. In addition, we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets.Net income from continuing operations was $684 million in 2017 compared to net income from continuing operations of $462 million and $438 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,678 million and $2,289 million, respectively.  On November 22, 2013, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2015 we repurchased 6 million shares for $267 million. For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time; however, we plan to repurchase a minimum of 674,000 shares per quarter in fiscal year 2018. Any additional repurchases may be impacted by our share price as well as other market conditions. During the year ended October 31, 2016, upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017 we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2017, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $610 million of our common stock under this program.During fiscal year 2017, we retired  294.2 million treasury shares at an aggregate cost of $10.7 billion,  the amount of which represents all of our previously repurchased shares over the past 12 years including 2017 repurchases. Also the retirement resulted in a decrease of $6.7 billion to retained earnings and a decrease of $4 billion to additional paid-in-capital. For the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, cash dividends of $170 million, $150 million and $133 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 15, 2017, we declared a quarterly dividend of  $0.149 per share of common stock, or approximately $48 million which will be paid on January 24, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 2, 2018. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. Looking forward, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of operating margin in our businesses by exploring new ways to simplify our operations, differentiate product solutions and improve our customers' experience.  In addition, we remain focused on returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We are entering fiscal year 2018 with good momentum. However, considering the macroeconomic and political uncertainties, and corresponding poor visibility on our end-markets for most of fiscal year 2018, we remain cautious on our revenue projections for most of fiscal year 2018. Therefore, we expect our revenue growth in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market to moderate slightly downward in fiscal year 2018.  Although we experienced strong revenue growth within the chemical and energy market in fiscal year 2017, we are expecting lower revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Within the clinical and diagnostics market, we 30Table of Contents            remain optimistic about our revenue growth opportunities in these markets and continue to invest in expanding and improving our solutions portfolio. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2017. Costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period.  Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.Inventory Valuation.    We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation.    We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis. The fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016. Shares granted under the Long-Term Performance Program based on Total Shareholders Return (""LTPP-TSR"") were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP based on Operating Margin (“LTPP-OM”) and LTPP based on 31Table of Contents            Earnings per share (“LTPP-EPS”) is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period is set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. The probable shares to vest are estimated based on the forecasted OM and EPS at the time of the grant and updated every quarter with latest forecast and actual information. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date. All awards granted in 2017 and 2016 to our senior management employees have a one year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model.Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the stock option grants in 2015 and LTPP (TSR) grants in 2015 and 2016, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For the 2017 LTPP (TSR) grants and calculation of the post-vest discount using the Finnerty model, we used our own post-separation historical stock price volatility. See Note 4, ""Share-based Compensation,"" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions.    Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2017 and 2016, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2017, discount rates for the U.S. plans were the same as the previous year. For 2017 and 2016, the discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2017, were approximately the same as the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million on U.S. pension expense and $16 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on U.S. pension expense and $9 million on non-U.S. pension expense. For 2017, actual return on assets was above expectations which, along with contributions during the year, decreased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in an improvement of the funded status at year end. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $15 million benefit in 2017, $3 million expense in 2016 and $26 million expense in 2015. The year ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, included a $32 million and  $16 million, respectively,  gain on curtailment and settlement.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.32Table of Contents            The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2017, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development (""IPR&D"") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2017, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on triggering events in the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded an impairment of  $4 million and $3 million, respectively due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects.Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October 31, 2017, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. and U.S state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the 33Table of Contents            U.S. in a future period of if there is a U.S. tax law change with respect to taxation of accumulated foreign earnings, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.As a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations.The U.S. Congress passed tax legislation on December 20, 2017 which broadly reforms the corporate tax system but the legislation must be signed by the U.S. President before it is considered enacted.  The tax reform could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and/or net deferred tax assets.  The tax reform law would reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, eliminates or limits deduction of several expenses which were previously deductible, imposes a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries, requires a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permits a tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction.  We are evaluating the overall impact of the tax reform on our effective tax rate and balance sheet but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time.Adoption of New PronouncementsSee Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements,"" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.Foreign CurrencyOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2017 and 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2016. Costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, reducing our overall net exposure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. 34Table of Contents            Results from OperationsNet Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016% Change 2016 over 2015   % Change 2017 2016 2015  (in millions)    Net revenue:         Products$3,410 $3,227 $3,146 6% 3%Services and other$1,062 $975 $892 9% 9%Total net revenue$4,472 $4,202 $4,038 6% 4%  Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016ppts Change 2016 over 2015ppts Change 2017 2016 2015 % of total net revenue:         Products76% 77% 78% (1) ppt (1) pptServices and other24% 23% 22% 1 ppt 1 pptTotal100% 100% 100%    Agilent's net revenue of $4,472 million in October 31, 2017 increased 6 percent when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements for 2017 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point compared to 2016. Agilent's net revenue of $4,202 million increased 4 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Product revenue includes revenue generated from the sales of our analytical instrumentation, software and consumables. Services and other revenue includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting including companion diagnostics. Services and other revenue increased 9 percent in 2017 as compared to 2016.  The service and other revenue growth is impacted by a portion of the revenue being driven by the current and previously installed product base. Service and other revenue increased due to continued strong companion diagnostics revenue and increases across nearly all service types. Services and other revenue increased 9 percent in 2016 as compared to 2015. Service and other revenue increased due to increased service contract repairs, compliance services and preventative maintenance, and strong companion diagnostics revenue.Net Revenue By Segment Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016% Change 2016 over 2015   % Change 2017 2016 2015  (in millions)    Net revenue by segment:         Life sciences and applied markets$2,169 $2,073 $2,046 5% 1%Diagnostics and genomics$772 $709 $662 9% 7%Agilent CrossLab$1,531 $1,420 $1,330 8% 7%Total net revenue$4,472 $4,202 $4,038 6% 4%Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 5 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016.  For the year ended October 31, 2017, our performance within the life sciences markets was led by solid growth in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets.  Within the applied markets, there was strong growth in the chemical and energy, food and environmental markets. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 1 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. For the year ended October 31, 2016 and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, acquisitions and the NMR business, our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.  Within the applied markets, and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the NMR business for 2016  when compared to 2015, there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets, but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets. 35Table of Contents            Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 9 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had no overall currency impact on revenue growth in 2017 when compared to 2016. For the year ended October 31, 2017, our performance within the clinical and diagnostics market continued to improve with strong revenue growth from our companion diagnostics and pathology businesses. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research markets continued to be strong, led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended October 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year. Revenue generated by Agilent CrossLab increased 8 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016.  Revenue grew across all key end markets led by strong growth in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical, chemical and energy and food markets. Revenue generated by Agilent CrossLab increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, there was growth in sales to all key markets.  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets. In addition, we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets. Costs and Expenses Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016Change 2016 over 2015Change 2017 2016 2015 Gross margin on products56.9% 54.6% 52.5% 2 ppts 2 pptsGross margin on services and other44.1% 44.5% 43.8% — 1 pptTotal gross margin53.9% 52.3% 50.5% 2 ppts 2 pptsOperating margin18.8% 14.6% 12.9% 4 ppts 2 ppts(in millions)         Research and development$339 $329 $330 3% —Selling, general and administrative$1,229 $1,253 $1,189 (2)% 5%Total gross margin for the year ended October 31, 2017 increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year. Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2017 reflects higher sales volume, results from margin improvement initiatives, lower amortization expense of intangible assets and the impact of an employee pension settlement gain partially offset by higher wages and variable pay.  Total gross margin for the year ended October 31, 2016 increased 2 percentage points when compared to last year. Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2016 were as a result of the exit of the NMR business, several margin improvement initiatives, lower logistics costs, lower costs to address the now lifted FDA warning letter offset by increased wages and variable pay. Total operating margin increased 4 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2017, when compared to last year. Operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margins, the impact of lower amortization expense of intangible assets, lower transformation initiatives costs, lower acquisition and integration costs and the impact of an employee pension settlement gain when compared to last year. Total operating margin increased 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2016, when compared to last year. Operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margin and the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain offset by the increased acquisition and integrations costs, the impairment charge for investment-related loans and increased wages and variable pay. Gross inventory charges were $24 million in 2017,  $20 million in 2016 and $30 million in 2015. Sales of previously written down inventory were $9 million in 2017, $9 million in 2016 and $13 million in 2015.  Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. Due to 36Table of Contents            the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.Research and development expenses increased 3 percent for the year ended October 31, 2017 when compared with last year. Research and development expenditures increased due to increased spending on new products related to all of our businesses, additional expenses related to increased headcount from acquisitions, and higher wages and variable pay.  Research and development expenses was relatively flat for the year ended October 31, 2016 when compared with last year. Research and development expenditures increased by a $4 million in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charge mostly offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower amortization expense from intangible assets, lower transformational initiatives,   lower acquisition and integration costs, the impact of an employee pension settlement gain and reduced costs due to business improvement initiatives partially offset by higher wages and variable pay and additional selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to acquisition and integration costs related to recently acquired businesses, higher wages and variable pay and an impairment charge related to equity method investment loans offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain.Interest expense for the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $79 million, $72 million and $66 million, respectively, and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts. At October 31, 2017, our headcount was approximately 13,500 compared to 12,500 in 2016. Other income (expense), netFor the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, other income (expense), net includes income of $12 million, $12 million and $25 million, respectively, related to the provision of certain IT and site service costs to, and lease income from, Keysight.  The costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations. Agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from Keysight over the next 2-3 years of approximately $12 million per year. For the year ended October 31, 2016, other income (expense), net also includes an $18 million expense related to the impairment of an investment. Income Taxes Years Ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Provision for income taxes$119 $82 $42For 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent.  Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This  benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.For 2016, the company's income tax expense was $82 million with an effective tax rate of 15.1 percent. The income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method investment impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized.For 2015, the company’s income tax expense from continuing operations was $42 million with an effective tax rate of 8.7 percent. The income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2015 included a net discrete tax 37Table of Contents            benefit of $(55) million primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS) audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends. Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. The tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $93 million, $86 million, and $65 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.29, $0.26, and $0.19 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2014 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2017. The U.S. statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 expired in July, 2017.  The statute expiration resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $40 million.  This discrete tax benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.On September 22, 2015, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") for the tax years 2008 through 2011.  The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $119 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company settled its ongoing tax audit in Italy for the years 2011 to 2013 resulting in a net tax expense of $7 million. The settlement resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $14 million. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company settled its ongoing tax audit in Germany for the years 2005 to 2008, which resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $51 million. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on December 1, 2015. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. The IRS appealed the decision and filed its arguments opposing the Tax Court decision in June 2016. The case is currently in the appeals process in the Ninth Circuit. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Court’s decision, we concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time.Segment OverviewThrough October 31, 2017, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, the diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. Life Sciences and Applied MarketsOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level.

Foreign currency movements for 2017 had an overall unfavorable currency impact of less than 1 percentage point on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. Geographically, revenue increased 2 percent in the Americas, increased 7 percent in Europe with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 5 percent in Asia Pacific. From a product standpoint, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, software and informatics systems, and cell analysis systems led with double digit growth during the year.  Gas chromatography returned to strong growth on the strength of rebounding chemical and energy markets.  Liquid chromatography grew single digits compared to 2016 as the pharmaceutical markets moderated.Life science and applied markets business revenue in 2016 increased 1 percent compared to 2015. Strong growth in China led the geographic portfolio during 2016, and helped offset softness in the Americas and Europe.  Liquid chromatography products revenue continued solid growth on strength in the pharmaceutical market.  Revenue from mass spectrometry had areas of strength, particularly in China, which were offset by continued declines in revenue in the chemical and energy markets as well as diagnostic and clinical market declines in the Americas.End market performance in 2017 showed a shift in growth trends from those of 2016.  Chemical and energy markets rebounded sharply from the depressed levels of 2016 and delivered strong growth.  The growth from pharmaceutical markets, which led the way in 2016, was modest reflecting difficult year on year comparisons.  Food and environmental markets demonstrated continued growth during the year.  Life science research and diagnostic and clinical market sales saw improvement as the year progressed. End market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2016.  Pharmaceutical market growth was robust in 2016 driven by continuing technology refresh programs. Food and environmental markets, driven by strong sales in China, were areas of good growth in an otherwise weak applied market sector.  Chemical and energy markets continued their declines throughout 2016 as oil prices remained low and capital budgets were constrained. Looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs. We anticipate strong sales funnels given new product introductions as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. While we anticipate volatility in our markets, we expect continued growth across most end markets. 39Table of Contents            Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the life sciences and applied markets business' margins, expenses and income from operations for 2017 versus 2016, and 2016 versus 2015. Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016Change 2016 over 2015Change 2017 2016 2015 Total gross margin60.1% 58.6% 56.2% 2 ppts 2 pptsOperating margin22.5% 20.7% 18.6% 2 ppts 2 ppts(in millions)         Research and development$206 $195 $192 6% 2%Selling, general and administrative$610 $590 $576 3% 2%Income from operations$487 $429 $380 13% 13%Gross margin increased 2 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016.

This business also includes our new acquisition “Multiplicom” a leading European diagnostics company with state-of-the-art genetic testing technology and products. Multiplicom’s solutions enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. 40Table of Contents            Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (""GMP"") conditions for use as active pharmaceutical ingredients (""API"") in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Next, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings to cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), in situ hybridization (“ISH”), hematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) staining and special staining. We also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Finally, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry.Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016Change 2016 over 2015Change 2017 2016 2015  (in millions)    Net revenue$772 $709 $662 9% 7%Diagnostics and genomics business revenue in 2017 increased 9 percent compared to 2016. Foreign currency movements for 2017 had no overall currency impact on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. Geographically, revenue increased 8 percent in the Americas with a 1 percentage point favorable currency impact, increased 10 percent in Europe with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and increased 10 percent in Asia Pacific. The growth in the Americas was assisted by continued strength in our nucleic acid solutions division, growth in sales in our pathology business and continuing strong growth in the companion diagnostic business. Pathology growth was a result of strength in all regions led by our companion diagnostics (""CDx"") assays and molecular pathology products. Europe results were supported by growth in our genomics, pathology, and the companion diagnostic business. Asia Pacific, our relatively smaller region, increased mainly due to higher shipment volumes in China and Japan.Diagnostics and genomics business revenue in 2016 increased 7 percent compared to 2015. The performance in Americas and Europe were assisted by growth in sales in genomics (particularly target enrichment and arrays), strength in pathology business, continued demand in the nucleic acid solutions and good momentum in the companion diagnostic business. Growth in Asia Pacific reflected strong growth in China. The 9 percent revenue growth in 2017 was due to positive growth from all businesses and regions. This was led by revenue growth in the companion diagnostics business working with our pharmaceutical partners. Nucleic acid business saw continued market demand in the nucleic acid solutions business related to therapeutic oligo programs and the pathology business saw steady growth due to strong utilization of Agilent’s Dako OMNIS platform and strength in our PD-L1 assays. The end markets in diagnostics and clinical research remain strong and growing driven by an aging population and lifestyle. The 7 percent revenue growth in 2016 was driven by demand in the nucleic acid solutions, good revenue performance in pathology and companion diagnostics businesses as well as next generation sequencing solution offering within the genomics business.Looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the diagnostics markets and continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio. We remain positive about our growth in these markets, as our Dako OMNIS products, PD-L1 assays and SureFISH continue to gain strength with our customers in clinical oncology applications and our next generation sequencing (target enrichment solutions) continue to be adopted. Market demand in the nucleic acid solutions business related to therapeutic oligo programs continues to be strong. We are investing in building further capacity in our nucleic acid business to address the demand for the oligos. We will continue to invest in research and development, and seek to expand our position in developing countries and emerging markets.41Table of Contents            Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the diagnostics and genomics business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2017 versus 2016, and 2016 versus 2015. Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016Change 2016 over 2015Change 2017 2016 2015 Total gross margin55.1% 54.6% 54.4% 1 ppt —Operating margin19.3% 16.0% 13.3% 3 ppts 3 ppts(in millions)         Research and development$84 $83 $78 1% 6%Selling, general and administrative$193 $190 $195 1% (2)%Income from operations$149 $114 $88 31% 29%Gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2017 when compared to 2016, mainly driven out of higher volume.

In 2017, revenue growth, from a percentage perspective, was led by the food market.  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in 2017 saw slower growth than in the prior year mostly due to a tougher comparison, but was still the primary growth driver from a volume perspective.  The chemical and energy market provided the same level of solid revenue growth in 2017 as  in 2016.  In 2016, the business saw positive revenue growth in all the key end markets after accounting for the unfavorable currency movements, and was led by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market, as well as the food market.Looking forward, we expect balanced strength in nearly all key end markets to drive growth in the near term.  Geographically, we remain optimistic on the market growth and market penetration opportunities in China and the emerging markets.  Other factors for near term revenue growth include upcoming product launches from our consumables pipeline, as well as on our investment in our laboratory enterprise offerings.Gross Margin and Operating MarginThe following table shows the Agilent CrossLab business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2017 versus 2016 and 2016 versus 2015. Years Ended October 31, 2017 over 2016Change 2016 over 2015Change 2017 2016 2015 Total gross margin49.5% 49.4% 49.6% — —Operating margin22.1% 22.3% 22.5% — —(in millions)         Research and development$49 $46 $46 7% —Selling, general and administrative$370 $339 $315 9% 7%Income from operations$338 $316 $299 7% 6%Gross margin was flat in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to the higher sales volume offset by higher wages and variable pay.  Gross margin was flat in 2016 when compared to 2015, due to the higher sales volume and several margin improvement initiatives which were partially offset by higher wages and variable pay, unfavorable currency movements and less favorable currency hedging results.Research and development expenses increased 7 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to increased investment related to an acquisition, as well as higher wages and variable pay.  Research and development expenses was flat in 2016 when compared to 2015, due to wage increases being offset by moderate favorable currency movements.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to higher orders driving higher selling costs, as well as higher wages and variable pay and the additional operating expenses from an acquisition.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to higher orders driving higher field selling costs, higher wages and variable pay and larger investments into marketing and the sales channel.43Table of Contents            Operating margin was flat in 2017 when compared to 2016, due to higher sales volume helping to offset growth in the number of service workforce, higher wages and variable pay and higher field selling costs.  Operating margin was flat in 2016 when compared to 2015, due to higher sales volume which was partially offset by higher wages and variable pay, unfavorable currency movements less favorable currency hedging results, and increased selling, general and administrative expenses.Income from OperationsIncome from operations in 2017 increased by $22 million or 7 percent when compared to 2016 on a revenue increase of $111 million.  This increase was due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher operating expenses.  Income from operations in 2016 increased by $17 million or 6 percent when compared to 2015 on a revenue increase of $90 million. This increase was due to higher sales volume, partially offset by currency and higher operating expenses.Financial ConditionLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur financial position as of October 31, 2017 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,678 million as compared to $2,289 million as of October 31, 2016.As of October 31, 2017, approximately $2,600 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under tax law effective through our 2017 fiscal year-end, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable tax credits. Agilent has accrued for U.S. federal and state tax liabilities on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are asserted as indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Repatriation could result in additional material U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years. In 2017, we assessed our overall cash needs and funding sources and determined a portion of our current year foreign earnings from our low-tax jurisdictions would be repatriated, the timing of which is dependent upon the recently passed U.S. tax legislation. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $889 million in 2017 as compared to $793 million provided in 2016 and $512 million provided in 2015. We paid approximately $63 million of net taxes in 2017, as compared to $67 million in net taxes in 2016 and net taxes of $129 million in 2015. The decrease in taxes paid for the year ended October 31, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to taxes paid related to the separation of Keysight in 2015 and to a lesser extent due to some tax refunds.  Cash paid for income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2015, included tax payments related to the separation of Keysight. For the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, other assets and liabilities used cash of $98 million, provided cash of $10 million and used cash of $249 million, respectively. The increase in cash usage for the year ended October 31, 2017 in other assets and liabilities is primarily due to pension contributions and taxes.In 2017, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $81 million, $33 million in 2016, and $24 million in 2015. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 55 days in 2017, 51 days in 2016 and 53 days in 2015. The change in accounts payable provided cash of $2 million in 2017, used cash of $15 million in 2016 and used cash of $26 million in 2015. Cash used in inventory was $61 million in 2017, in $7 million in 2016 and $24 million in 2015. Inventory days on-hand increased to 95 days in 2017 compared to 92 days in 2016 and decreased compared to 97 days in 2015. We contributed $25 million, zero and $15 million to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We contributed $21 million, $24 million and $25 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We contributed less than $1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year.  Total contributions in 2017 were $46 million or 92 percent more than 2016.  Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and expect to contribute $22 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans and nothing to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2018.44Table of Contents            Net Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities in 2017 was $305 million and in 2016 was $238 million as compared to net cash used of $400 million in 2015. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $176 million in 2017, $139 million in 2016 and $98 million in 2015. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were zero in 2017 and 2016, and $12 million in 2015. In 2017 we invested $128 million in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash acquired compared to $261 million in 2016 and $74 million in 2015.  In 2017 there were approximately $1 million purchases of cost method investments compared to $80 million outlay in 2016 and zero in 2015. Change in restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1 million outflow in 2017, $245 million inflow in 2016 and $240 million outflow in 2015, respectively (changes in 2016 and 2015  related to our Seahorse Biosciences acquisition).Net Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $202 million compared to $268 million in 2016 and $1,089 million in 2015, respectively. Treasury Stock Repurchases On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2015 we repurchased 6 million shares for $267 million. For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time; however, we plan to repurchase a minimum of 674,000 shares per quarter in fiscal year 2018. Any additional repurchases may be impacted by our share price as well as other market conditions. During the year ended October 31, 2016, upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017 we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2017, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $610 million of our common stock under this program.During fiscal year 2017, we retired  294.2 million treasury shares at an aggregate cost of $10.7 billion,  the amount of which represents all of our previously repurchased shares over the past 12 years including 2017 repurchases. Also the retirement resulted in a decrease of $6.7 billion to retained earnings and a decrease of $4.0 billion to additional paid-in-capital.Dividends For the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 cash dividends of $170 million, $150 million and $133 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 15, 2017 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.149 per share of common stock, or approximately $48 million which will be paid on January 24, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 2, 2018. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Credit FacilityOn September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of October 31, 2017, the company had $110 million  outstanding under the facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. 45Table of Contents            Short-term and Long-term DebtIn October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2017 senior notes""). On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes.  The remaining $100 million in senior notes matured and were paid in full on November 1, 2017.In July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2020 senior notes""). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commenced on January 15, 2011.On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2017 was $11 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.In September 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes (""2022 senior notes""). The 2022 senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year, payments commenced on April 1, 2013.In June 2013, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2023 senior notes""). The 2023 senior notes were issued at 99.544% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year and payments commenced January 15, 2014.  On September 15, 2016, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $300 million in senior notes (""2026 senior notes""). The 2026 senior notes were issued at 99.624% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 22, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.050% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 22nd  and September 22nd of each year and payments commenced March 22, 2017.  In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2017 was $9 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and OtherWe have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 15, ""Commitments and Contingencies"", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.46Table of Contents            Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2017 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsOperating leases$42 $52 $16 $26Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers384 4 — —Other purchase commitments40 — — —Retirement plans22 — — —Transitional pension contributions to our U.S. 401(k) plan$8 $15 $12 $—Total$496 $71 $28 $26Operating Leases.    Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see Note 15, ""Commitments and Contingencies"".Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.    We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, in the past we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2017, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was $1 million compared to less than $1 million as of October 31, 2016 and $5 million as of October 31, 2015. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other Purchase Commitments.    We have categorized ""other purchase commitments"" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under ""other purchase commitments"" were approximately $40 million within the next year. Retirement Plans.    Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2017 or October 31, 2016.47Table of Contents            On Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2017 related to our  debt and interest expense (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsSenior notes$100 $500 $400 $900Credit facility(1)110 — — —Interest expense74 141 90 61Total$284 $641 $490 $961(1)  The credit facility expires on September 15, 2019.Other long-term liabilities include $131 million and $190 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2016, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.  48Table of Contents            ",">Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 51 percent of our revenue in 2017, 54 percent of our revenue in 2016 and 57 percent of our revenues in 2015 were generated in U.S. dollars.The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, has decreased revenue by approximately 1 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2017. The impact of foreign currency movements is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.  We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.49Table of Contents            ",">Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements Page   Consolidated Financial Statements:  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 51Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2017 52Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2017 53Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2017 and 2016 54Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2017 55Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2017 56Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 57Quarterly Summary (unaudited) 10250Table of Contents            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Agilent Technologies, Inc.:In our opinion, the  accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP   San Jose, California December 21, 2017 51Table of Contents            AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESOverview.    Agilent Technologies Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Keysight Separation.  On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight Technologies, Inc. (""Keysight"") to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. For fiscal year 2015, discontinued operations includes costs incurred to effect the separation of Keysight and certain costs associated with transition services provided by Agilent to Keysight. No income or expense has been recorded for the Keysight business after separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014.Exit of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Business. Beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we ceased the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance (“NMR”) product line within our life sciences and applied markets segment. In connection with the exit from this business, we recorded approximately $6 million in restructuring and other related costs in 2015.  The exit of the NMR business was completed in fiscal year 2016.Basis of Presentation.    The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.Principles of Consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Reclassification.  Certain reclassifications to our prior period consolidated balance sheet have been made to conform with our current reporting.  The October 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet reflects the reclassification of $8 million of intangible assets related to purchased technology and licenses from third parties that were not associated with a business combination from other assets to other intangible assets.Use of Estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes.Retirement of Treasury Shares.  Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital, based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings.  All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares.Revenue Recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. Provisions for discounts, warranties, returns, extended payment terms, and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.57Table of Contents            Product Revenue.   Product revenue includes revenue generated from the sales of our analytical instrumentation, software and consumables.  Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of analytical instrumentation. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and has been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.Service Revenue.  Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer and software support including, Software as a Service (SaaS), consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition, the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.  Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of measurement instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized upon delivery once title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Delivery of installation, start-up services and other services varies based on the complexity of the equipment, staffing levels in a geographic location and customer preferences, and can range from a few days to a few months. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules which require vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue in a multiple element arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.We have evaluated the deliverables in our multiple-element arrangements and concluded that they are separate units of accounting if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met.We use VSOE of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. VSOE of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. TPE of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. As our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish TPE. ESP represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by management. We may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. As these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in ESP. The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.58Table of Contents            For sales arrangements that include equipment lease along with other products or services, revenue is allocated to the different elements based on the Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements.  Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a capital (sales-type) lease using lease classification guidance.Deferred Revenue.    Deferred revenue represents the amount that is allocated to undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements. We limit the revenue recognized to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or meeting other specified performance conditions.Accounts Receivable, net.    Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 was not material. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.Shipping and Handling Costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.Inventory.    Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.   In fiscal year 2017, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not- that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development (""IPR&D"") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.59Table of Contents            Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2017, there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based on triggering events in the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded an impairment of  $4 million and $3 million, respectively due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects. Share-Based Compensation.    For the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program (""LTPP"") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting.  Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense, in continuing operations, for all share-based awards of $61 million in 2017, $60 million in 2016 and $55 million in 2015. See Note 4, ""Share-based Compensation"" for additional information.Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans.   Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans.  Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.   Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually.   See Note 13, “Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans” for additional information. Taxes on Income.    Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 5, ""Income Taxes"" for more information.Warranty.    Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 14, ""Guarantees"".Advertising.    Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $38 million in 2017, $30 million in 2016 and $25 million in 2015.Research and Development.    Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Sales Taxes.    Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.Net Income Per Share.    Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 6, ""Net Income Per Share"".Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments.  We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.As of October 31, 2017, approximately $2,600 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. Under current tax laws, the cash could be repatriated to the U.S. but most of it would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable tax credits. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short term deposits held at 60Table of Contents            major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.We classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Currently, we have no short-term investments.Variable Interest Entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).  The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis.  We have determined that as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no VIE’s required to be consolidated in the company’s consolidated financial statements because we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the VIE’s that we have invested in nor are we the primary beneficiary.  We account for these investments under either the equity or cost method, depending on the circumstances.  We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. During 2016, we wrote down an equity method investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $18 million.  In addition, we recorded an impairment of $7 million of uncollectible loans related to this equity method investment.During the year ended October 31, 2016, Agilent made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen for $80 million.  Agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and we have also joined the board of Lasergen and signed a collaboration agreement. We have the option to acquire all of the remaining shares of Lasergen until March 2, 2018, for additional consideration of $105 million. Lasergen is a VIE, however, we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance.  Because of the nature of the preferred stock of Lasergen that we own, we account for this investment under the cost method.  As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our investments in VIE’s was $80 million with a maximum exposure of $80 million.  The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value because we do not have future funding commitments. The investment is included on the long term investments line of the consolidated balance sheet.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method, their carrying value approximates their estimated fair value. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of October 31, 2017. The fair value of our senior notes, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy, exceeds the carrying value by approximately $58 million and $104 million as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in the excess of fair value over carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2017 is primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.  The carrying value as of October 31, 2016 reflects the new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs which we adopted on November 1, 2016. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 11, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.Investments. Cost method investments consisting of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.Concentration of Credit Risk.    Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis. 61Table of Contents             Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of combined accounts receivable as of October 31, 2017, or 2016.Derivative Instruments.    Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options and, in the past, interest rate swaps to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months and interest rate swaps, if any, mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedges, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was not material.  Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.Property, Plant and Equipment.    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.Leases.    We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one year to twenty years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to six years. In addition, we lease equipment to customers in connection with our diagnostics business using both capital and operating leases. As of October 31, 2017 and 2016 our diagnostics and genomics segment has approximately $27 million and $15 million, respectively, of lease receivables related to capital leases and approximately $22 million and $23 million, respectively, of net assets for operating leases.  We depreciate the assets related to the operating leases over their estimated useful lives, typically five years.Capitalized Software.    We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years once development is complete.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.62Table of Contents            Employee Compensation and Benefits.    Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $101 million and $92 million as of October 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.Foreign Currency Translation.    We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and was $2 million loss for fiscal year 2017, $5 million loss for 2016 and $9 million loss for 2015, respectively. 2.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued amendments to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs remain unchanged. The amendments were effective for us beginning November 1, 2016.  The impact of adoption to our consolidated balance sheet was a decrease of $8 million in other assets and long-term debt.  The October 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet has been revised to reflect the new disclosure requirement.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance, Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from contract with customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The objective of the new revenue standard is to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The guidance is effective for us at the beginning in November 1, 2018. We expect to adopt this standard on November 1, 2018 through application of the modified retrospective method reflecting the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance to revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Under the new guidance, there are specific criteria to determine if a performance obligation should be recognized over time or at a point in time. We expect that in some cases the revenue recognition timing under the new guidance will change from current practice.  We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify accounting for adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in connection with business combinations.   Beginning in November 1, 2017 and in the interim periods from November 1, 2018, adjustments will be recorded in the period that they are determined rather than applied retrospectively via revision to the period of acquisition and each period thereafter.   We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In January 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The provisions under this amendment are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is not permitted. We currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and 63Table of Contents            lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2019, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted and we will be required to adopt using a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the timing of adoption and the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2016, the FASB issued amendments to simplify the transition to the equity method of accounting. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2017, and for interim periods within that year. We currently do not expect material impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted.  If we decide to early adopt the amendments, we will be required to adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  We do not expect to early adopt and we are evaluating the impact of the amendments on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  We are evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact of the amendments on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In November 2016, the FASB issued amendments to require amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect to early adopt and we are evaluating the impact of the amendments on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.  In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance intended to clarify the definition of a business in connection with business combinations with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.  This guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Adjustments will be recorded in the period that they are determined rather than applied retrospectively via revision to the period of acquisition and each period thereafter.   We do not expect to early adopt this guidance nor do we expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In January 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amendment also simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  We do not expect to early adopt nor do we expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. This guidance also specifies that only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization. The standard requires employers to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and to report the other components of net periodic benefit costs (which include interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credits and actuarial gains and losses) separately and below operating income in the statement of operations. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods.  We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance to our consolidated financial statements.In May 2017, the FASB issued an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting intended to better align a company's risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance 64Table of Contents            for qualifying hedging relationships and presentation of hedge results.  The amendments expand and refine accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and align the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and hedged item in the financial statements.   The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2019, including the interim periods within those annual periods.  We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced its intention to separate its electronic measurement business, Keysight, which was previously a separate reportable segment, into a stand-alone publicly traded company.  Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013.   On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Keysight to Agilent stockholders, who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The separation agreement ensured that Keysight had approximately $700 million of total cash and cash equivalents immediately following distribution. For the year ended October 31, 2015, we transferred a total amount of cash and cash equivalents of $734 million to Keysight.  The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of Keysight included in the consolidated statement of operations: Year Ended October 31, 2015 (in millions)Net revenue$—Costs and expenses39Operating loss(39)Other income (expense), net—Loss from discontinued operations before tax(39)Benefit for income taxes(2)Net loss from discontinued operations$(37)   For the year ended October 31, 2015, net income (loss) from discontinued operations includes transaction, information systems and other costs to effect the separation of $39 million. In the year ended October 31, 2015 only those costs incurred to effect the separation of Keysight have been included. No income or expense has been recorded for the Keysight business after separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014.In addition, $332 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, primarily related to pension and other post-retirement benefits plans and currency translation was also transferred to Keysight together with $28 million of additional paid in capital related to share based compensation windfall tax benefits. The removal of Keysight net assets and equity related adjustments is presented as a reduction in Agilent's retained earnings and represents a non cash financing activity excluding cash transferred.  Under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, we recorded income for all services provided to Keysight of approximately $12 million in fiscal year 2015. In addition, Agilent expects to receive lease income together with site service income from Keysight over the next 2-3 years of approximately $12 million per year.  In the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 other income (expense), net includes $12 million, $12 million and $25 million of income related to the provision of services to, and lease income from Keysight. 65Table of Contents            4.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Description of Share-Based PlansEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.    Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Agilent on November 1, or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 75 million shares.Under our ESPP, employees purchased 618,270 shares for $26 million in 2017, 696,178 shares for $23 million in 2016 and 346,472 shares for $12 million in 2015. As of October 31, 2017, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 27,556,310. This excludes the number of shares of common stock to be issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participants contributions totaling $15 million as of October 31, 2017.Incentive Compensation Plans.    On November 19, 2008 and March 11, 2009, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the ""2009 Stock Plan"") to replace the Company's 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Stock Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and subsequently reserved 25 million shares of Company common stock that may be issued under the 2009 Plan, plus any shares forfeited or cancelled under the 1999 Stock Plan. The 2009 Stock Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (""SARs""), restricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2009 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2017, 8,140,709 shares were available for future awards under the 2009 Stock Plan.Stock options under the 2009 Stock Plans may be either ""incentive stock options"", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options were granted prior to November 1, 2015 and generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. Stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016. Agilent issues new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program administered under the 2009 Stock Plan, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets over the three-year period are met.   The performance target for grants made in 2016 and 2017 were based on Operating Margin (“OM”) and Earnings Per Share (""EPS""), respectively. In the case of LTPP-OM, the performance targets for all the three years of performance period is set at the time of grant. The performance targets for LTPP-EPS grants for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period will be set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Based on the performance metrics the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years and the maximum award value for awards granted in 2017 and 2016 cannot exceed 300 percent of the grant date target value. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met.We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted 66Table of Contents            for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.Impact of Share-based Compensation AwardsWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Cost of products and services$15 $14 $11Research and development6 6 5Selling, general and administrative40 40 39Total share-based compensation expense$61 $60 $55At October 31, 2017 and 2016 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory.  The weighted average grant date fair value of options, granted in 2015 was $10.58 per share. Stock options were granted in years prior to fiscal year 2016.Included in the 2015 expense is an incremental expense for the acceleration of share-based compensation related to the announced workforce reduction plan of $2 million. No such expense was recorded for 2017 or 2016. Upon termination of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction, the non-vested Agilent awards held by these employees immediately vests. Employees have a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. Valuation AssumptionsFor all periods presented, the fair value of share based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date.The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards, LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and as appropriate, a discount related to the one-year post vesting. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) and LTPP (EPS) awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.67Table of Contents            The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and LTPP grants. Years Ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015Stock Option Plans:     Weighted average risk-free interest rate— — 1.75%Dividend yield— — 1%Weighted average volatility— — 28%Expected life— — 5.5 yearsLTPP:     Volatility of Agilent shares23% 24% 25%Volatility of selected peer-company shares15%-63% 14%-50% 12%-57%Price-wise correlation with selected peers36% 35% 37%      Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards5.3% 5.5% —Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the stock option grants in 2015 and LTPP (TSR) grants in 2015 and 2016, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believed our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight in 2015 was no longer relevant to use. For LTPP (TSR) grants in 2017, we used our own historical stock price volatility.           All LTPP awards granted in 2017 and 2016 to our executives have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares. For 2016, the model used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount. For 2017, the model used Agilent's own post-separation historical stock price volatility. The grants made during 2017 and 2016 have a discount of 5.3 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, while computing the fair values.68Table of Contents            Share-Based Payment Award ActivityEmployee Stock OptionsThe following table summarizes employee stock option award activity of our employees and directors for 2017.  OptionsOutstanding  WeightedAverageExercise Price (in thousands)  Outstanding at October 31, 20164,106 $33Granted— $—Exercised(1,343) $30Cancelled/Forfeited/Expired(2) $41Outstanding at October 31, 20172,761 $34Forfeited and expired options from total cancellations in 2017 were as follows: OptionsCancelled WeightedAverageExercise Price (in thousands)  Forfeited2 $41Expired— $—Total options cancelled during 20172 $41The options outstanding and exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October 31, 2017 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options ExercisableRange ofExercise PricesNumberOutstanding WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue NumberExercisable WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue (in thousands) (in years)   (in thousands) (in thousands) (in years)   (in thousands)$0 - 25170 1.6 $18 $8,561 170 1.6 $18 $8,561$25.01 - 30957 4.3 $26 39,804 957 4.3 $26 39,804$30.01 - 40528 6.1 $39 15,258 296 6.1 $39 8,566$40.01 - over1,106 7.0 $41 30,035 493 7.0 $41 13,396 2,761 5.6 $34 $93,658 1,916 5.0 $31 $70,327The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $68.03 at October 31, 2017, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date.

During the third quarter of 2017, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as 71Table of Contents            indefinitely reinvested.  As such, a liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in ending deferred tax liability. Agilent records U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2017 the company recognized a $163 million deferred tax liability for the overall residual tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested. As of October 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested was $5.8 billion. No deferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the company’s foreign operations. Due to the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, the determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings is not practicable. The breakdown between long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows for the years 2017 and 2016: October 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Long-term deferred tax assets (included within other assets)$240 $386Long-term deferred tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(77) (65)Total$163 $321Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2017, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $138 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is mainly related to deferred tax assets for California R&D credits, net operating losses in the state of Colorado and the Netherlands and capital losses in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.At October 31, 2017, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10 million, $670 million and $310 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will both begin to expire in 2018. If not utilized, $124 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. The remaining $186 million of the foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2017, we had federal and foreign capital loss carryforwards of $48 million and $129 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022. The foreign capital losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2017, we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards, net of reserves. of approximately $144 million and $55 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018. The state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.

The tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023. As a result of the incentives, 72Table of Contents            the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $93 million, $86 million, and $65 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.29, $0.26, and $0.19 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.For 2017, the company's income tax expense was $119 million with an effective tax rate of 14.8 percent.  Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. During the year, the company determined a portion of current year foreign earnings from its low tax jurisdictions would not be considered as indefinitely reinvested. As such, a deferred tax liability for that portion of unremitted foreign earnings was accrued causing an increase in the annual tax expense.  Our annual effective tax rate also included tax benefits due to the settlement of an audit in Germany for the years 2005 through 2008 and the lapse of U.S. statute of limitation for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.For 2016,  the company's income tax expense was $82 million with an effective tax rate of 15.1 percent. The income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million primarily due to tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized.For 2015, the company’s income tax expense was $42 million with an effective tax rate of 8.7 percent. The income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2015 included a net discrete tax benefit of $55 million primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS) audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends. The breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows for the years 2017 and 2016: October 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Current income tax assets (included within other current assets)$77 $83Long-term income tax assets (included within other assets)18 19Current income tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities)(55) (49)Long-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(131) (190)Total$(91) $(137)The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.73Table of Contents            The aggregate changes in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Balance, beginning of year$293 $289 $417Additions for tax positions related to the current year32 31 33Additions for tax positions from prior years1 1 3Reductions for tax positions from prior years(3) (27) (156)Settlements with taxing authorities(52) — (4)Statute of limitations expirations(47) (1) (4)Balance, end of year$224 $293 $289As of October 31, 2017, we had $224 million of unrecognized tax benefits of which $202 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a tax benefit of $9 million, a tax expense of $2 million and a tax benefit of $2 million of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 were $16 million and $25 million, respectively.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2014 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. There were no substantial changes to the status of these open tax years during 2017. The U.S. statute of limitation for audit of tax returns for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 expired in July, 2017.  The statute expiration resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $40 million.  This discrete tax benefit was offset by a deferred tax liability required for the tax expected upon repatriation of related unremitted foreign earnings that were not asserted as indefinitely invested outside the U.S.On September 22, 2015, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") for the tax years 2008 through 2011. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $119 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company settled its ongoing tax audit in Italy for the years 2011 to 2013 resulting in a net tax expense of $7 million. The settlement resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $14 million. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company settled its ongoing tax audit in Germany for the years 2005 to 2008, which resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $51 million. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on December 1, 2015. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. The IRS appealed the decision and filed its arguments opposing the Tax Court decision in June 2016. The case is currently in the appeals process in the Ninth Circuit. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Court’s decision, we concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time.74Table of Contents            6.     NET INCOME PER SHAREThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below.  Years Ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Numerator:     Income from continuing operations$684 $462 $438Loss from discontinued operations$— $— $(37)Net income684 462 401Denominators:     Basic weighted average shares322 326 333Potential common shares — stock options and other employee stock plans4 3 2Diluted weighted average shares326 329 335The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. We issued a total of 3 million share-based awards in each year of  2017, 2016 and 2015.We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, options to purchase zero, 842,200 and 1.2 million shares respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. In addition, we also exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.  For the year ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, options to purchase 200 shares, 229,600 shares and 368,900 shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.7.     INVENTORY October 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Finished goods$363 $339Purchased parts and fabricated assemblies212 194Inventory$575 $533Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges, included in continuing operations, of $24 million were recorded in total cost of products in 2017, $20 million in 2016 and $30 million in 2015, respectively.

In 2017, we acquired Cobalt Light Systems (“Cobalt”), an Oxfordshire, U.K. based provider of differentiated Raman spectroscopic instruments for the pharmaceutical industry, applied markets and public safety, for approximately $53 million in cash and Multiplicom NV (“Multiplicom”), a leading European diagnostics company with state-of-the-art genetic testing technology and products, for approximately $72 million in cash. We have not included the pro forma impact of these acquisitions since they are not material to our current or prior period results. During 2017, we recorded additions to goodwill of $78 million and to other intangible assets of $52 million related to these acquisitions. During 2017, other intangible assets increased $5 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. During 2017, we also wrote-off the gross carrying amount of $132 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets which were no longer being used.In 2016, we acquired Seahorse Bioscience, a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics, for $242 million and iLab Solutions LLC (""iLab""), a cloud-based solutions provider for core laboratory management for $26 million.    In 2016, we recorded additions to goodwill of $156 million and to intangible assets of $121 million related to these acquisitions. During the year other intangible assets decreased $2 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation.There were no impairments of other intangible assets recorded during 2017.  In addition, we recorded impairments of other intangibles related to the cancellation of in-process research and development projects of $4 million and $3 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.                                                                                                                           Amortization expense of intangible assets was $120 million in 2017, $154 million in 2016, and $158 million in 2015. 77Table of Contents            Future amortization expense related to existing finite-lived purchased intangible assets associated with business combinations for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is estimated below:Estimated future amortization expense:  (in millions)2018$942019$692020$572021$432022$32Thereafter$4210.   INVESTMENTSThe following table summarizes the company's equity investments as of October 31, 2017 and 2016 (net book value): October 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Long-Term   Cost method investments$106 $104Trading securities32 31Total$138 $135Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and a fund and are accounted for at historical cost. Approximately $80 million relates to our variable interest entity investment, see Note 1, ""Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"". Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. During the year ended October 31, 2016, we identified certain events and circumstances that indicated the decline in value of an equity method investment was other-than-temporary.  As a result, we wrote down the investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of approximately $18 million.Amounts included in other income (expense), net for the appropriate share of loss on equity method investments and other than temporary impairments were as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Equity method investments - share of losses$— $(10) $(9)Equity method investments - other than temporary impairments — (18) —Total$— $(28) $(9)Net unrealized gains on our trading securities portfolio were $4 million in 2017, $1 million in 2016 and $2 million in 2015.11.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.78Table of Contents            Fair Value HierarchyThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2017 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement atOctober 31, 2017 Using October 31, 2017 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,659 $1,659 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)4 — 4 —Long-term       Trading securities32 32 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,695 $1,691 $4 $—Liabilities:       Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$6 $— $6 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability32 — 32 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$38 $— $38 $—79Table of Contents            Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2016 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement atOctober 31, 2016 Using October 31, 2016 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,482 $1,482 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)9 — 9 —Long-term       Trading securities31 31 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,522 $1,513 $9 $—Liabilities:      Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$8 $— $8 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability31 — 31 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$39 $— $39 $—Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable.Trading securities, which is comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisLong-Lived AssetsFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Years EndedOctober 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Long-lived assets held and used$— $4 $3Long-lived assets held for sale$— $— $—For 2017, there were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used. Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $4 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $4 million, which was included in net income for 2016. Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $3 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $3 million, which was included in net income for 2015.  The impairment 80Table of Contents            charge in 2016 and 2015 of $4 million and $3 million, respectively, relates to IPR&D projects that were abandoned and written down to their fair value of zero. There were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets were measured using level 2 inputs.12.   DERIVATIVESWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options, and interest rate swaps, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.Fair Value HedgesWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. The fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and, in the past, we have used interest rate swaps to change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short term investments. As of October 31, 2017, all interest rate swap contracts had either been terminated or had expired. On August 9, 2011, we terminated five interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The gain to be amortized at October 31, 2017 was $11 million. All deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective senior notes.  Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to other income (expense) in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) over the life of the option contract.  For the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, ineffectiveness and gains and losses recognized in earnings due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012.  We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2017 was $2 million. In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2017 was $9 million. 81Table of Contents            Other HedgesAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2017, was $4 million. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2017.There were 71 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2017 and designated as cash flow hedges.

Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the ""RP""), defined benefits which are based on an employee's base or target pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plans is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the ""DPSP""), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. Effective November 1, 2014, Agilent’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan is closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires. As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen.  See Plan Amendments below.As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $156 million and $157 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.83Table of Contents            In addition to the DPSP, in the U.S., Agilent maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""SBRP""), supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the ""U.S. Plans"" in the tables below.Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements.401(k) Defined Contribution Plan.    Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan.  Effective April 30, 2016, we began matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation.  Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen.  The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $33 million in 2017, $24 million in 2016 and $14 million in 2015.Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Plans.    In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. Eligible retirees who were less than age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for a fixed amount which can be utilized to pay for either sponsored plans and/or individual medicare plans. Effective January 1, 2012, employees who were at least age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for fixed dollar subsidies and stipends. Grandfathered retirees receive a fixed monthly subsidy toward pre-65 premium costs (subsidy capped at 2011 levels) and a fixed monthly stipend post-65. The subsidy amounts will not increase. In addition, any new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the retiree medical plans upon retiring. Current eligible employees will continue to participate in the retiree medical program in place as of November 1, 2014.  Retirees will maintain the retiree medical benefits they are eligible for as of November 1, 2014.  As of April 30, 2016, benefits under this plan were changed - see Plan Amendments below.Plan Amendments. In 2016, we made changes to our U.S. Retirement Plan and Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""U.S. Plans"").  Effective April 30, 2016, benefit accruals under the U.S. Plans were frozen.  Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there were no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016.  In addition, active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service - as of April 30, 2016 - will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement.Due to these plan amendments, we recorded a curtailment gain of $15 million in the U.S. Plans during the year ended October 31, 2016. In addition, we recognized a settlement gain of $1 million related to the U.S. Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan during the year ended October 31, 2016.Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law. In Japan, Agilent has employees' pension fund plans, which are defined benefit pension plans established under the Japanese Welfare Pension Insurance Law (JWPIL). The plans are composed of (a) a substitutional portion based on the pay-related part of the old-age pension benefits prescribed by JWPIL (similar to social security benefits in the United States) and (b) a corporate portion based on a contributory defined benefit pension arrangement established at the discretion of the company. During the year ended October 31, 2017, Agilent received government approval and returned the substitutional portion of Japan's pension plan to the Japanese government, as allowed by the JWPIL. The initial transfer resulted in a net gain of $32 million recorded within cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The net gain consisted of two parts - a gain of $41 million, representing the difference between the fair values of the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) settled of $65 million and the assets transferred from the pension trust to the government of Japan of $24 million, offset by a settlement loss of $9 million related to the recognition of previously unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In December 2017, after the Japanese government’s final review of our initial payment,  we received a $5.2 million refund. We will record a settlement gain related to the refund in fiscal 2018.84Table of Contents            Components of Net periodic cost.    The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. For the years ended October 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of:  Pensions U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans                    2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Net periodic benefit cost (benefit)                 Service cost — benefits earned during the period$— $12 $25 $19 $19 $18 $1 $1 $2Interest cost on benefit obligation15 16 14 12 16 23 3 4 4Expected return on plan assets(25) (25) (27) (41) (44) (42) (7) (7) (8)Amortization of net actuarial loss3 3 3 36 27 25 11 10 6Amortization of prior service benefit— (3) (5) — — — (9) (10) (12)Total periodic benefit cost (benefit)$(7) $3 $10 $26 $18 $24 $(1) $(2) $(8)Curtailments and settlements$— $(16) $— $(32) $— $— $— $— $—Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss                 Net actuarial (gain) loss$(19) $22 $44 $(128) $149 $32 $(9) $3 $16Amortization of net actuarial loss(3) (3) (3) (36) (27) (25) (11) (10) (6)Prior service cost (benefit)— 15 — — — — 9 (7) —Amortization of prior service benefit— 3 5 — — — — 10 12Gain due to settlement— — — 32 — — — — —Foreign currency— — — 2 (3) 10 — — —Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss$(22) $37 $46 $(130) $119 $17 $(11) $(4) $22Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss$(29) $24 $56 $(136) $137 $41 $(12) $(6) $1485Table of Contents            Funded Status.    As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S.Post-RetirementBenefit Plans 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions)Change in fair value of plan assets:           Fair value — beginning of year$341 $347 $774 $778 $88 $91Actual return on plan assets66 13 81 25 14 3Employer contributions25 — 21 24 — —Participants' contributions— — — 1 — —Benefits paid(18) (19) (23) (27) (7) (6)Settlements— — (26) — — —Currency impact— — 28 (27) — —Fair value — end of year$414 $341 $855 $774 $95 $88Change in benefit obligation:           Benefit obligation — beginning of year$434 $415 $1,002 $900 $103 $112Service cost— 12 19 19 1 1Interest cost15 16 12 16 3 4Participants' contributions— — — 1 — —Plan amendment— — (1) — — (7)Actuarial (gain) loss15 41 (43) 130 (3) (1)Benefits paid(19) (20) (22) (27) (7) (6)Curtailments— (30) — — — —Settlements— — (70) — — —Currency impact— — 38 (37) — —Benefit obligation — end of year$445 $434 $935 $1,002 $97 $103Overfunded (underfunded) status of PBO$(31) $(93) $(80) $(228) $(2) $(15)Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:           Other assets$— $— $86 $1 $— $—Employee compensation and benefits(1) (1) — — — —Retirement and post-retirement benefits(30) (92) (166) (229) (2) (15)Total net asset (liability)$(31) $(93) $(80) $(228) $(2) $(15)Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss):           Actuarial (gains) losses$65 $93 $243 $375 $20 $41Prior service costs (benefits)— — (1) — (28) (37)Total$65 $93 $242 $375 $(8) $4The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized by Agilent as components of net expense during 2018 are as follows: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit)$— $— $(8)Amortization of actuarial net loss (gain)$1 $29 $886Table of Contents            Investment Policies and Strategies as of October 31, 2017 and 2016. In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately, 5 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 37 to 60 percent to equities, from 37 to 60 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate investments and from zero to 7 percent to cash, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2017 and 2016 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as the practical expedient.   In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund.Fair Value.    The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 11, ""Fair Value Measurements"".Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments.Equity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock that are not traded on an active market are valued at quoted prices reported by investment dealers based on the underlying terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Other Investments - Other investments also includes partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3.Agilent has adopted new accounting guidance related to the presentation of certain investments using the NAV practical expedient. The accounting guidance exempts investments using this practical expedient from categorization within the fair value hierarchy. Agilent applied the adoption of this standard retrospectively and removed certain investments from the fair value hierarchy in both periods.87Table of Contents            The following tables present

next 10 years: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)2018$29 $23 $82019$28 $25 $82020$31 $26 $82021$29 $29 $72022$30 $32 $72023 - 2027$145 $176 $34Assumptions.    The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2017 and 2016, were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally 91Table of Contents            based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate3.75% 4.20% 4.00%Average increase in compensation levelsn/a 3.50% 3.50%Expected long-term return on assets7.25% 7.50% 8.00%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate0.22-2.66% 0.77-3.76% 1.50-4.00%Average increase in compensation levels2.00-4.25% 2.25-4.00% 2.50-3.25%Expected long-term return on assets4.00-6.25% 4.25-6.50% 4.00-6.50%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:     Discount rate3.50% 4.00% 4.00%Expected long-term return on assets7.25% 7.50% 8.00%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 7.00% 8.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029 2028Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: As of the Years Ending October 31, 2017 2016U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate3.75% 3.75%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate0.67-2.52% 0.40-2.62%Average increase in compensation levels2.00-3.25% 2.00-4.25%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:   Discount rate3.50% 3.50%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 6.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029Health care trend rates do not have a significant effect on the total service and interest cost components or on the post-retirement benefit obligation amounts reported for the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan for the year ended October 31, 2017.14.   GUARANTEESStandard WarrantyWe accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend to one years from the date of delivery, depending on the product.92Table of Contents            A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities. October 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Balance as of October 31, 2016 and 2015$35 $31Accruals for warranties including change in estimates53 53Settlements made during the period(54) (49)Balance as of October 31, 2017 and 2016$34 $35Accruals for warranties due within one year33 34Accruals for warranties due after one year1 1Balance as of October 31, 2017 and 2016$34 $35Indemnifications in Connection with TransactionsIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future.  These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2017.  Indemnifications to Officers and DirectorsOur corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2017.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2017.In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2017.93Table of Contents            15.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOperating Lease Commitments:    We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at October 31, 2017 were $42 million for 2018, $33 million for 2019, $19 million for 2020, $10 million for 2021, $6 million for 2022 and $26 million thereafter. Future minimum lease income under leases at October 31, 2017 was $9 million for 2018, $9 million for 2019, $8 million for 2020, and $10 million thereafter. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense was $57 million in 2017, $61 million in 2016 and $65 million in 2015.Contingencies:     We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.16.   SHORT-TERM DEBTCredit FacilitiesOn September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million and on July 14, 2017, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by an additional $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $1 billion. As of October 31, 2017, the company had borrowings of $110 million outstanding under the facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016. 2017 Senior Notes                                               In October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2017 senior notes""). On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes.  The 2017 senior notes are repayable within one year as of October 31, 2017 and have been reclassified to short-term debt. The remaining $100 million in senior notes matured and were paid in full on November 1, 2017. 17.   LONG-TERM DEBTSenior NotesThe following table summarizes the company's long-term senior notes and the related interest rate swaps: October 31, 2017 October 31, 2016 AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total AmortizedPrincipal Swap Total (in millions)2017 Senior Notes$— $— $— $100 $1 1012020 Senior Notes499 11 510 498 15 5132022 Senior Notes398 — 398 398 — 3982023 Senior Notes596 — 596 595 — 5952026 Senior Notes297 — 297 297 — 297Total$1,790 $11 $1,801 $1,888 $16 $1,904On November 1, 2016, we adopted new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet.  As a result, the amortized principal of long-term debt decreased by $8 million. The table above for October 31, 2016 reflects the new disclosure requirement. Please refer to Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements"" for additional information. 94Table of Contents            2020 Senior NotesIn July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2020 senior notes""). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commenced on January 15, 2011.On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2017 was $11 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes.2022 Senior NotesIn September 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes (""2022 senior notes""). The 2022 senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year, payments commenced on April 1, 2013.2023 Senior NotesIn June 2013, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes (""2023 senior notes""). The 2023 senior notes were issued at 99.544% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year and payments commenced January 15, 2014.  2026 Senior NotesOn September 15, 2016, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $300 million in senior notes (""2026 senior notes""). The 2026 senior notes were issued at 99.624%% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 22, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.050% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 22nd and September 22nd of each year and payments commenced March 22, 2017.  In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2017 was $9 million. Other DebtIn  2016, we paid approximately $37 million of our mortgage debt, secured on buildings in Denmark, to a Danish financial institution.   The gain recognized upon early payment was not material. No balance exists on this debt as of October 31. 2016.18.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYStock Repurchase Program On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares.  For the year ended October 31, 2015 we repurchased 6 million shares for $267 million. For the year ended October 31, 2016 we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $98 million which completed the purchases under this authorization.On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 95Table of Contents            2016, upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2017 we repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $194 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2017, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $610 million of our common stock under this program.During fiscal year 2017, we retired  294.2 million treasury shares at an aggregate cost of $10.7 billion,  the amount of which represents all of our previously repurchased shares over the past 12 years including repurchases made in fiscal year 2017. The retirement of these treasury shares resulted in a decrease of $6.7 billion to retained earnings and a decrease of $4.0 billion to additional paid-in-capital.Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock During the year ended October 31, 2017, cash dividends of $0.528 per share, or $170 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash dividends of $0.460 per share, or $150 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2015, cash dividends of $0.400 per share, or $133 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 15, 2017 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.149 per share of common stock, or approximately $48 million which will be paid on January 24, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 2, 2018. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The following table summarizes the components of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, net of tax effect: October 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Foreign currency translation, net of tax expense of $(8) and $(5) for 2017 and 2016, respectively$(156) (197)Unrealized losses (including prior service benefit) on defined benefit plans, net of tax benefit of $127 and $176 for 2017 and 2016, respectively(188) (305)Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax benefit of $2 and $2 for 2017 and 2016, respectively(2) (1)Total accumulated other comprehensive loss$(346) $(503)96Table of Contents            Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component and related tax effects for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions):    Net defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs      Foreign currency translation Prior service credits Actuarial Losses Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives Total  (in millions)As of October 31, 2015 $(189) $161 $(365) $2 $(391)           Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (5) 6 (171) (10) (180)           Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income — (29) 43 3 17           Tax benefit (3) 8 42 4 51           Other comprehensive loss (8) (15) (86) (3) (112)           As of October 31, 2016 $(197) $146 $(451) $(1) $(503)           Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 44 — 116 — 160           Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income — (9) 59 (1) 49           Tax (expense) benefit (3) 3 (52) — (52)           Other comprehensive income (loss) 41 (6) 123 (1) 157           As of October 31, 2017 $(156) $140 $(328) $(2) $(346)           97Table of Contents            Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions):   Details about accumulated otherAmounts ReclassifiedAffected line item incomprehensive income componentsfrom other comprehensive incomestatement of operations20172016Unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives$1$(3) Cost of products1(3)Total before income tax—— (Provision)/benefit for income tax1(3)Total net of income taxNet defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs:Actuarial net loss(59)(43)Cost of sales and operating expensesPrior service benefit929Cost of sales and operating expenses(50)(14)Total before income tax144 (Provision)/benefit for income tax(36)(10)Total net of income taxTotal reclassifications for the period$(35)$(13)Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions to income and increases to other comprehensive income.Reclassifications of prior service benefit and actuarial net loss in respect of retirement plans and post retirement pension plans are included in the computation of net periodic cost (see Note 13 ""Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans"").19.   SEGMENT INFORMATIONDescription of Segments.  We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission 98Table of Contents            spectrometry (""ICP-OES"") instruments; raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; laboratory software and informatics systems; laboratory automation; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of five areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ngredients (""APIs"") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (""NGS"") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. This business also includes our new acquisition “Multiplicom” a leading European diagnostics company with state-of-the-art genetic testing technology and products. Multiplicom’s solutions enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (""GMP"") conditions for use as active pharmaceutical ingredients (""API"") in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Next, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings to cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), in situ hybridization (“ISH”), hematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) staining and special staining. We also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Finally, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.  The majority of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices.  Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab.  Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies.  Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software as a service, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity.  Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirementsA significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring and transformational expenses, acquisition and integration costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments.The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.99Table of Contents            The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab TotalSegments (in millions)Year ended October 31, 2017:       Total net revenue$2,169 $772 $1,531 $4,472Income from operations$487 $149 $338 $974Depreciation expense$35 $30 $29 $94Share-based compensation expense$30 $10 $21 $61Year ended October 31, 2016:       Total net revenue$2,073 $709 $1,420 $4,202Income from operations$429 $114 $316 $859Depreciation expense$36 $31 $28 $95Share-based compensation expense$29 $10 $21 $60Year ended October 31, 2015:       Total net revenue$2,046 $662 $1,330 $4,038Income from operations$380 $88 $299 $767Depreciation expense$27 $37 $34 $98Share-based compensation expense$27 $9 $18 $54The following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Total reportable segments' income from operations$974 $859 $767Business exit and divestiture costs ( primarily our NMR business)— (11) (12)Asset Impairments— (4) (3)Transformational initiatives(12) (38) (56)Amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations(117) (152) (156)Acquisition and integration costs(30) (41) (13)Acceleration of share-based compensation expense related to workforce reduction— — (2)Pension curtailment gain— 15 —Pension settlement gain32 1 —Impairment of loans— (7) —Other(6) (7) (3)Interest Income22 11 7Interest Expense(79) (72) (66)Other income (expense), net19 (10) 17Income from continuing operations before taxes, as reported$803 $544 $480Major Customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015.100Table of Contents            The following table presents assets and capital expenditures attributed to each segment.

Generally, these organizations are centrally operated from Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2016, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,500 people worldwide.Agilent Order Fulfillment OrganizationsOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (“OFS”) centralizes all order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.        The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (""R&D"") expenditures were $329 million in 2016, $330 million in 2015 and $358 million in 2014, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. BacklogWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.Materials Our life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.EnvironmentalOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.12Table of Contents            In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnity the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future.  The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the business that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers as we well as other specified items, including potential liabilities for environmental matters.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2016.  We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.International OperationsOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2016, 70 percent in fiscal 2015 and 75 percent in fiscal 2014, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 20 percent in fiscal 2016, 16 percent in fiscal 2015 and 13 percent in fiscal 2014. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based on where we ship the products or provide the services.Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 44 percent in fiscal year 2016 and 49 percent in fiscal year 2015. Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 19, ""Segment Information"", to our consolidated financial statements.Acquisition and Disposal of Material AssetsOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one comprising of the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that retained the Agilent name, and the other one that comprised of the electronic measurement business that was renamed Keysight Technologies, Inc. (“Keysight”). Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013. On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014.

Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. A large amount of our orders are back-end loaded toward the end of our second and fourth fiscal quarters and their timing may be influenced by the sales incentive programs we have in place. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.15Table of Contents            If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;•innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;•manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;•price our products competitively;•anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and•control product quality in our manufacturing process.General economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:•reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;•increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increased price pressure for our products and services; and•greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.Demand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.   Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, spending priorities, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.16Table of Contents            Economic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2016. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•negative consequences from changes in tax laws including changes to U.S. tax legislation that could materially increase our effective tax rate;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•differing protection of intellectual property;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and•geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.We centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.17Table of Contents            Our strategic initiatives could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.We have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.Our acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result, in unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.  In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and the retention of key customers.The integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls.  In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, management concluded that, because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2015.   We remediated the material weakness for income tax as of October 31, 2016.   However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to 18Table of Contents            prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.Integrating Dako A/S may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.We may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of Dako. In addition, the operation of Dako within Agilent may be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:•our response to significant competitive pressure;•difficulties in meeting new product timelines;•the ability to grow in emerging markets;•increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements; •increased costs to address certain governmental regulations and compliance issues, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) warning letter received in August 2013 which has now been lifted by the FDA;•increased costs and use of resources; and•difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel.Even if we are able to successfully operate Dako within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the Dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment,  labor and immigration,  import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.A number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory 19Table of Contents            agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.Some of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.Some of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other similar things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be  subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.Our business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting.  If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.The impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.The life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet 20Table of Contents            product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.Certain properties transferred to Keysight Technologies, Inc. (“Keysight”) as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) (together ""HP"") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP.  HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination.  HP will have access to those Keysight properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require Keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that Keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs.  We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations, in which case Keysight may seek indemnification from us. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.Other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP, we have agreed to indemnify HP, with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations, and Keysight, with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation, at, respectively, properties transferred from HP to us and properties transferred by us to Keysight.  While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago Technologies Ltd. and Advantest Corporation and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, even if the sites outside the United States are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.As part of our acquisition of Varian, Inc. (“Varian”) we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (""VSEA"") to each indemnify Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (“VMS”) for certain costs relating to (a) environmental 21Table of Contents            investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (""VAI"") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) EPA or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered unlikely. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.Our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our 22Table of Contents            intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations from time to time. Any changes in corporate income tax laws relating to transfer pricing or repatriation of capital, any changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations, or any implementation of tax laws relating to proposals to curb base erosion and profit shifting or proposals for fundamental U.S. and foreign corporate tax reform, could lead to increases in overall tax liability, which could materially impact our effective tax rate and have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. We are also subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.Agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Agilent's taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.We have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Although the cash generated in the United States from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019.  On June 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $700 million and retained a provision that allows us to further increase commitments to the credit facility by $300 million in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions. As of October 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:23Table of Contents            •increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; •requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.As of October 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,289 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.24Table of Contents            We could incur significant liability if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters.

(""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.In November 2015, we completed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience (""Seahorse""), a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics for $242 million in cash.  Seahorse's technology enables researchers to better understand cell health, function and signaling, and how the cell may be impacted by the introduction of a specific drug, by providing real-time kinetics to unlock essential cellular bioenergetics data. The financial results of Seahorse have been included within Agilent's consolidated financial statements from November 1, 2015.On March 2, 2016, Agilent made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen for $80 million.  Agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and we have also joined the board of Lasergen and signed a collaboration agreement. We have the option to acquire all of the remaining shares of Lasergen until March 2, 2018, for additional consideration of $105 million. Lasergen is a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), however, we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance nor are we the primary beneficiary.  Because of the nature of the preferred stock of Lasergen that we own, we account for this investment under the cost method. On August 1, 2016 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of iLab Solutions LLC (""iLab""), a cloud-based solutions provider for core laboratory management.  iLab's offerings enables customers to easily and accurately book time in shared facilities, to bill and invoice for projects, to manage studies, to generate reports and business intelligence, and to schedule instrument reservations across multiple projects. The purchase price was $26 million in cash. The financial results of iLab have been included within Agilent's consolidated financial statements from August 1, 2016.Agilent's net revenue of $4,202 million in 2016 increased 4 percent when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements for 2016 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2015. Agilent's net revenue of $4,038 million was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014. The life sciences and applied markets business brings together Agilent's analytical laboratory instrumentation and informatics. Revenue increased 1 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. For the year ended October 31, 2016 and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, acquisitions and the NMR business our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.  Within the applied markets, and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the NMR business, there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets, but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets. Revenue decreased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. For the year ended October 31, 2015 and 30Table of Contents            excluding the impact of currency movements and the NMR business, our performance within the life sciences business showed consistent revenue growth from sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from sales to the life sciences research market. Within applied markets and excluding the impact of currency movements and the NMR business, there was weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. The diagnostics and genomics business includes genomics, nucleic acid contract manufacturing and the pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnership businesses.  Revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets continued to be strong, led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended October 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year.  Revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding foreign currency movements, our growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets was strong in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. The Agilent CrossLab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business. Revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, there was growth in sales to all key markets.  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets. In addition, we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets. Revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets, in particular, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. Within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements. Net income from continuing operations was $462 million in 2016 compared to net income from continuing operations of $438 million and $232 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,289 million and $2,003 million, respectively.   On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. For the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $98 million, 6 million shares for $267 million and 4 million shares for $200 million, respectively. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016, upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.  For the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 cash dividends of $150 million, $133 million and $176 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 16, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.132 per share of common stock, or approximately $43 million which will be paid on January 25, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2017. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. Looking forward, we expect to continue to focus on the growth of the operating margin in our businesses by simplifying our operations, differentiating product solutions and improving our customer's experience. We anticipate returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. End market growth outlook in today's uncertain political and economic environment is unpredictable and challenging.  However, we expect continued strength in the pharmaceutical markets and solid growth in the food and environmental markets but we remain uncertain about the growth in the chemical and energy markets.  The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2016. Costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates 31Table of Contents            will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our performance for the near future. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.Revenue recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.We use VSOE of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. VSOE of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. TPE of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. As our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish TPE. ESP represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by management. We may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. As these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in ESP. The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.Inventory valuation.    We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Agilent announced it is exiting the NMR business, and as a result, recorded an excess inventory charge of $30 million. For the year ended October 31, 2015 and 2016 additional excess inventory charges were recorded in respect of the exiting of the NMR business of $4 million and $2 million, respectively.32Table of Contents            Share-based compensation.    We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis. The fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No stock options were granted in 2016. Shares granted under the Long-Term Performance Program based on Total Shareholders Return (""LTPP-TSR"") were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards and LTPP based on Operating Margin (“LTPP-OM”) is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date. All awards granted in 2016 to our senior management employees have a one year post-vest holding restriction and the value of these awards are adjusted for this.Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock.  No options were granted in 2016. Due to the separation of Keysight on November 1, 2014, expected volatility for grants of options in 2015 was based on a 5.5 year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believe our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight is no longer relevant.  In developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 5.8 years for 2014, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants, which we believed was representative of future behavior. See Note 4, ""Share-based Compensation,"" to the consolidated financial statements for more information. For the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after November 1, 2010, we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, the company elected to early adopt new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. For additional details related to the new guidance see Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements.""Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.    Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2015 and 2016, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2016, discount rates for the U.S. Plans decreased 75 basis points from the previous year. For 2016 and 2015, the discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2016, decreased 60 basis points to 110 basis points from the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million on U.S. pension expense and $16 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on U.S. pension expense and $7 million on non-U.S. pension expense. For 2016, actual return on assets was below expectations which, along with contributions during the year, increased next year’s pension cost as well as resulting in a degradation of the funded status at year end. The net 33Table of Contents            periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were $3 million in 2016, $26 million in 2015 and $15 million in 2014. The year ended October 31, 2016, included a $16 million gain on curtailment and settlement.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.  In fiscal year 2016, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2016. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development (""IPR&D"") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2016. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. In the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded an impairment of $4 million, $3 million and $4 million, respectively, due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects. In addition, in the year ended October 31, 2014, we also recorded $12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our NMR business.Accounting for income taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets 34Table of Contents            that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our U.S. deferred tax assets. At October 31, 2016, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. and U.S state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.As a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations.Adoption of New PronouncementsSee Note 2, ""New Accounting Pronouncements,"" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.Foreign CurrencyOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2016 and 6 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2015. Costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, reducing our overall net exposure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, Agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. 35Table of Contents            Results from OperationsNet Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2016 over 2015% Change 2015 over 2014% Change 2016 2015 2014  (in millions)    Net revenue:         Products$3,227 $3,146 $3,185 3% (1)%Services and other$975 $892 $863 9% 4%Total net revenue$4,202 $4,038 $4,048 4% —  Years Ended October 31, 2016 over 2015Ppts Change 2015 over 2014Ppts Change 2016 2015 2014 % of total net revenue:         Products77% 78% 79% (1) ppt (1) pptServices and other23% 22% 21% 1 ppt 1 pptTotal100% 100% 100%    Agilent's net revenue of $4,202 million in October 31, 2016 increased 4 percent when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements for 2016 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2015. Agilent's net revenue of $4,038 million was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014. Services and other revenue includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting including companion diagnostics. Services and other revenue increased 9 percent in 2016 as compared to 2015.  The service and other revenue growth is impacted by a portion of the revenue being driven by the current and previously installed product base. Service and other revenue increased due to increased service contract repairs, compliance services and preventative maintenance, and strong companion diagnostics revenue. Services and other revenue increased 4 percent in 2015 as compared to 2014.Net Revenue By Segment Years Ended October 31, 2016 over 2015% Change 2015 over 2014% Change 2016 2015 2014  (in millions)    Net revenue by segment:         Life sciences and applied markets$2,073 $2,046 $2,078 1% (2)%Diagnostics and genomics$709 $662 $663 7% —Agilent CrossLab$1,420 $1,330 $1,307 7% 2%Total net revenue$4,202 $4,038 $4,048 4% —The life sciences and applied markets business brings together Agilent's analytical laboratory instrumentation and informatics.

For the year ended October 31, 2016 and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, acquisitions and the NMR business our performance within the life sciences market continued to show strong revenue growth from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.  Within the applied markets, and excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and the NMR business, there was strong growth in both the environmental and food markets, but revenue from sales to other applied markets was weak with a decline in revenue from sales to the chemical and energy markets. Revenue decreased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. For the year ended October 31, 2015 and excluding the impact of currency movements and the NMR business, our performance within the life sciences business showed consistent revenue growth from sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from sales to the life sciences research market. Within applied markets and excluding the impact of currency movements and the NMR business, there was weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. 36Table of Contents            The diagnostics and genomics business includes genomics, nucleic acid contract manufacturing and the pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnership businesses.  Revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research markets continued to be strong, led by our companion diagnostics and genomics businesses in the year ended October 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year.  Revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding foreign currency movements, our growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets was strong in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. The Agilent CrossLab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business. Revenue increased 7 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points in 2016 when compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, there was growth in sales to all key markets.  The phamaceutical and biotechnology markets led all the markets in revenue and revenue growth along with very strong revenue growth from the food markets. In addition, we saw moderate growth from the environmental market and modest revenue growth from the chemical and energy markets. Revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets, in particular, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. Within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements.

Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2016 were as a result of the exit of the NMR business, several margin improvement initiatives, lower logistics costs, lower costs to address the now lifted FDA warning letter offset by increased wages and variable pay.  Total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2015 increased 2 percentage points when compared the prior year.  Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2015 were the result of lower intangible asset amortization, favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency movements and wage increases.Total operating margin increased 2 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2016, when compared to last year. Operating margins increased due to improvements in gross margin and the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain offset by the increased acquisition and integrations costs, the impairment charge for investment-related loans and increased wages and variable pay. Total operating margins increased 3 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2015, when compared to last year. Operating margins improved due to increased gross margins and reduced expenses on lower revenue compared to last year. Gross inventory charges, included in continuing operations, were $20 million in 2016, $30 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2014. Sales of previously written down inventory, included in continuing operations, were $9 million in 2016, $13 million in 2015 and $8 million in 2014.  Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. Due to 37Table of Contents            the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.Research and development expenses was relatively flat for the year ended October 31, 2016 when compared with last year. Research and development expenditures increased by a $4 million in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charge mostly offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain.  Research and development expenses decreased 8 percent for the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared with last year. R&D expenditure decreased due to the impact of foreign currency movements, savings from the exit from the NMR business and transformation initiatives, offset by wage increases.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to acquisition and integration costs related to recently acquired businesses, higher wages and variable pay and an impairment charge related to equity method investment loans offset by the impact of an employee pension curtailment gain. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. There were increases in expenditure mostly due to the impact of wage increases, higher commissions and costs associated with business improvement and transformation initiatives more than offset by favorable foreign currency movements and the decline in NMR expenses due to the exiting of that business together with a decrease in pre separation expenses related to the separation of Keysight. Interest expense for the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $72 million, $66 million and $110 million, respectively, and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts. The decrease in interest expense in 2015 compared with 2014 is due to debt redemptions as part of the debt repositioning as a result of the separation of the Keysight business.At October 31, 2016, our headcount was approximately 12,500 compared to 11,800 in 2015. Other income (expense), netFor the year ended October 31, 2016 other income (expense), net includes an $18 million expense related to the impairment of an investment and $12 million of income in respect of the provision of certain site service costs to, and lease income from, Keysight. The costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations. Agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from Keysight over the next 3-4 years of approximately $12 million per year. For the year ended October 31, 2015, other income (expense), net included $25 million of income in respect of the provision of certain IT and site service costs to, and lease income from, Keysight. For the year ended October 31, 2014 other income (expense) net, included a net loss on the early redemption of senior notes of $89 million. Income Taxes Years Ended October 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Provision (benefit) for income taxes$82 $42 $(3)For 2016, the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 15.1 percent. The income tax expense from continuing operations was $82 million. The income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million. The net discrete tax expense for the year ended October 31, 2016, included $5 million of tax benefit for the extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit attributable to the company's prior fiscal year, $6 million of tax expense related to the curtailment gain recognized with respect to the U.S. retirement plan and Supplemental Benefits Plan, $18 million of tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized, and a net $2 million of other discrete tax benefit. Included in the net $2 million discrete tax benefit are $9 million of out-of-period correcting tax expense entries recorded in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year of 2016 associated with German return-to-provision corrections. These are offset by an $11 million out-of-period tax benefit associated with an adjustment to the deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings.  The out-of-period corrections were determined to be immaterial to the previously issued and current period financial statements.For 2015, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was 8.7 percent. The income tax expense from continuing operations was $42 million. The income tax benefit for the year ended October 31, 2015 included a net discrete benefit 38Table of Contents            of $55 million primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends.For 2014, the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was (1.3) percent. The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $3 million. The income tax benefit for the year ended October 31, 2014 included a net discrete benefit of $33 million primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends.Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. The tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $86 million, $65 million, and $27 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.26, $0.19, and $0.08 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.On November 1, 2014, Agilent transferred deferred tax assets of $237 million, deferred tax liabilities of $37 million, current income tax payable of $40 million, and other long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling $8 million to Keysight as part of its separation from Agilent. A current prepaid income tax asset of $19 million and long-term prepaid income tax asset of $3 million related to sales of intercompany assets was also transferred to Keysight upon separation from Agilent. In addition, for the year ended October 31, 2015, a $6 million return to provision adjustment for Keysight associated with bonus depreciation was recognized through retained earnings.In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. On September 22, 2015, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") for the tax years 2008 through 2011. During the first quarter of 2016, we made a payment of approximately $9 million of tax plus interest as part of closing the exam. In 2015, we reclassified a portion of other long-term liabilities to other accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations that we expected to pay within the next twelve months. This amount was partially offset by a prepaid tax account of approximately $3 million that the IRS allowed as an offset to the $12 million in incremental taxes. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $119 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.On January 29, 2014, we reached an agreement with the IRS for the tax years 2006 through 2007. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $111 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $75 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on December 1, 2015. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. The IRS notified the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on February 19, 2016 of its intent to appeal the Tax Court's decision in the case. We concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case.39Table of Contents            Segment OverviewThrough October 31, 2016, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. Life Sciences and Applied MarketsOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (""ICP-OES"") instruments; cell analysis plate based assays; laboratory software and informatics systems; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2016 over 2015Change 2015 over 2014Change 2016 2015 2014  (in millions)    Net revenue$2,073 $2,046 $2,078 1% (2)%Life science and applied markets business revenue in 2016 increased 1 percent compared to 2015. Foreign currency movements for 2016 had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. Geographically, revenue declined 6 percent in the Americas with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact.  Revenue declined 8 percent in Europe with a 4 percentage point unfavorable currency impact.  Revenue grew 7 percent in Japan with an 8 percentage point favorable currency impact.  Revenue grew 14 percent in Asia Pacific excluding Japan with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact.  Strong growth in China led the geographic portfolio during 2016, and helped offset softness in the Americas and Europe.  Liquid chromatography products revenue continued solid growth on strength in the pharmaceutical market.  Revenue from mass spectrometry had instances of strength, particularly in China, which were offset by continued declines in revenue in the chemical and energy markets as well as diagnostic and clinical market declines in the Americas.  Life science and applied markets business revenue in 2015 decreased 2 percent compared to 2014. During 2015 we exited the research products business, which reduced overall life sciences and applied markets growth by 2 percentage points.  Product revenue results were otherwise solid across the rest of the product portfolio.  Strength in the Americas and Europe pharmaceutical business were offset by softness in applied markets and life science research.End market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2016.  Pharmaceutical market growth continued to be robust in 2016 driven by continuing technology refresh programs.  The growth led the way for life sciences and diagnostics markets, which were offset somewhat by lower diagnostic and clinical sales, notably in the US related to a slowdown in pain management related sales. Food and environmental markets, driven by strong sales in China, were areas of good growth in an otherwise weak applied market sector.  Chemical and energy markets continued their declines throughout 2016 as oil prices remain low. Markets were also mixed for 2015 with pharmaceutical growth offset by delayed capital spending in life science research markets, and chemical and energy weakness from low oil prices. Looking forward, we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in the life sciences and applied markets as our broad portfolio of products and solutions are well suited to address customer needs. We expect strong sales funnels given a number of significant new product introductions in the next few quarters as we continue to invest in expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolio.

Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Agilent has accrued for U.S. federal and state tax liabilities on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Repatriation could result in additional material U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $793 million in 2016 as compared to $512 million provided in 2015 and $731 million provided in 2014. For the year ended October 31, 2014 net cash provided by operating activities included the cash provided by Keysight operating activities. We paid approximately $67 million of net taxes in 2016, as compared to $129 million in net taxes in 2015 and net taxes of $131 million in 2014. Income taxes, including those paid for the Keysight business, were paid by Agilent for the year ended October 31, 2014. The decrease in taxes paid for the year ended October 31, 2016 was primarily due to no taxes paid related to the separation and to a lesser extent due to some refund of taxes.  Cash paid for income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2015 included tax payments related to the separation. Operating cash flows in 2014 were impacted by pre-separation costs and separation related taxes, the redemption of senior notes including payments related to accrued interest and the timing of the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan. For the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 other assets and liabilities provided cash of $10 million and used cash of $249 million and $26 million, respectively. The increase in the usage of cash for the year ended October 31, 2015 in other assets and liabilities was largely the result of contributions to defined benefit plans, changes in interest and restructuring accruals, income tax liabilities and transaction tax assets and liabilities.In 2016, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $33 million, $24 million in 2015, and $119 million in 2014.

The increase in cash used in 2015 when compared to 2014 was largely due to the net cash transferred to Keysight.Treasury stock repurchases On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. For the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $98 million, 6 million shares for $267 million and 4 million shares for $200 million, respectively. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

See Note 15, ""Commitments and Contingencies"", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2016 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsOperating leases$38 $60 $22 $26Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers359 3 — —Other purchase commitments62 — — —Retirement plans45 — — —Total$504 $63 $22 $26Operating leases.    Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see Note 15, ""Commitments and Contingencies"".Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.    We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, in the past we recorded a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2016, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was less than $1 million compared to $5 million, as of October 31, 2015 and $10 million as of October 31, 2014. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other purchase commitments.    We have categorized ""other purchase commitments"" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under ""other purchase commitments"" were approximately $62 million within the next year. Retirement Plans.    Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate.We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2016 or October 31, 2015.48Table of Contents            On Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2016 related to our long-term debt and interest expense (in millions): Less than oneyear One to three years Three to five years More than five yearsSenior notes$— $100 $500 $1,300Interest expense77 144 116 106Total$77 $244 $616 $1,406Other long-term liabilities include $190 million and $227 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.  49Table of Contents            ",">Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 54 percent of our revenue in 2016, 57 percent of our revenue in 2015 and 61 percent of our revenues in 2014 were generated in U.S. dollars.The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, has decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2016. The impact of foreign currency movements is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows.We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk.  We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt.50Table of Contents            ",">Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements Page   Consolidated Financial Statements:  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 52Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2016 53Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2016 54Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2016 and 2015 55Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2016 56Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2016 57Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58Quarterly Summary (unaudited) 10451Table of Contents            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Agilent Technologies, Inc.:In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for deferred income taxes and share-based payments in 2016.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP   San Jose, California December 20, 2016 52Table of Contents            AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

POLICIESOverview.    Agilent Technologies Inc. (""we"", ""Agilent"" or the ""company""), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.Keysight Separation.  On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight Technologies, Inc. (""Keysight"") to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The historical results of operations and the financial position of Keysight are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and are reported as discontinued operations within this Form 10-K.Exit of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we made the decision to cease the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance (“NMR”) product line within our life sciences and applied markets segment. In connection with the exit from this business, we recorded approximately $6 million and $68 million in restructuring and other related costs in 2015 and 2014, respectively.   The exit of the NMR business was completed in fiscal year 2016.Basis of presentation.    The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.Principles of consolidation.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Use of estimates.    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes.Revenue recognition.    We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. Provisions for discounts, warranties, returns, extended payment terms, and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded.Product revenue.    Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of analytical instrumentation. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and has been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. 58Table of Contents            We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.Service revenue.  Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer and software support including, Software as a Service (SaaS) due to recent acquisitions, consulting including companion diagnostics and training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition, the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.Revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables.  Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of measurement instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized upon delivery once title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Delivery of installation, start-up services and other services varies based on the complexity of the equipment, staffing levels in a geographic location and customer preferences, and can range from a few days to a few months. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules which require vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value to allocate revenue in a multiple element arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.We have evaluated the deliverables in our multiple-element arrangements and concluded that they are separate units of accounting if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met.We use VSOE of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. VSOE of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. TPE of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. As our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish TPE. ESP represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by management. We may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. As these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in ESP. The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.For sales arrangements that include equipment lease along with other products or services, revenue is allocated to the different elements based on the Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements.  Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a capital (sales-type) lease using lease classification guidance.Deferred revenue.    Deferred revenue represents the amount that is allocated to undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements. We limit the revenue recognized to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or meeting other specified performance conditions.Accounts receivable, net.    Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2016 and 2015 was not material. 59Table of Contents            We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.Shipping and handling costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.Inventory.    Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.Goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.   In fiscal year 2016, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2016. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not- that the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development (""IPR&D"") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2016. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. Based on triggering events in the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded an impairment of $4 million, $3 million and $4 million, respectively due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects. In addition, 60Table of Contents            in the year ended October 31, 2014, we also recorded $12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our NMR business.Share-based compensation.    For the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (""ESPP"") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program (""LTPP"") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting.  Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense, in continuing operations, for all share-based awards of $60 million in 2016, $55 million in 2015 and $59 million in 2014. For the stock option grants in 2015 and long term performance plan grants in 2016 and 2015 we used a volatility measure derived from a selection of our peer companies.  In prior periods, we used Agilent stock historical volatility. We currently consider this method to not be reflective of our future volatility due to the separation of Keysight. See Note 4, ""Share-based compensation"" for additional information.Retirement and post-retirement plans.   Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans.  Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.   Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually.   See Note 13, “Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans” for additional information. Taxes on income.    Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 5, ""Income Taxes"" for more information.Warranty.    Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 14, ""Guarantees"".Advertising.    Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $30 million in 2016, $25 million in 2015 and $31 million in 2014.Research and development.    Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Sales taxes.    Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.Net income per share.    Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 6, ""Net Income Per Share"".Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.  We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.As of October 31, 2016, approximately $2,181 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Under current tax laws, the cash could be repatriated to the U.S. but most of it would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short term deposits held at major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.We classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Currently, we have no short-term investments.61Table of Contents            Variable interest entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”).  The company evaluates its investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis.  We have determined that as of October 31, 2016 there were no VIE’s required to be consolidated in the company’s consolidated financial statements because we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the VIE’s that we have invested in nor are we the primary beneficiary.  We account for these investments under either the equity or cost method, depending on the circumstances.  We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. During 2016, we wrote down an equity method investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $18 million.  In addition, we recorded an impairment of $7 million of uncollectible loans related to this equity method investment.  As of October 31, 2016, the carrying value of our investments in VIE’s was $80 million with a maximum exposure of $80 million.  The investments are included on the long term investments line of the consolidated balance sheet.  During the year ended October 31, 2016, Agilent made a preferred stock investment in Lasergen for $80 million.  Agilent’s initial ownership stake was 48 percent and we have also joined the board of Lasergen and signed a collaboration agreement. We have the option to acquire all of the remaining shares of Lasergen until March 2, 2018, for additional consideration of $105 million. Lasergen is a VIE, however, we do not consolidate the entity in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance.  Because of the nature of the preferred stock of Lasergen that we own, we account for this investment under the cost method.  As of October 31, 2016, both the carrying value and maximum exposure of the Lasergen investment was $80 million.  The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value because we do not have future funding commitments. Fair value of financial instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the cost or equity method, their carrying value approximates their estimated fair value. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid. The fair value of our long-term debt, calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy, exceeds the carrying value by approximately $96 million and $30 million as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 11, ""Fair Value Measurements"" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.Concentration of credit risk.    Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.  Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of combined accounts receivable as of October 31, 2016, or 2015.Derivative instruments.    Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options and, in the past, interest rate swaps to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months and interest rate swaps, if any, mature at the same time as the maturity 62Table of Contents            of the debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedges, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was not material.  Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.Property, plant and equipment.    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.Leases.    We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one year to twenty years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to six years. In addition, we lease equipment to customers in connection with our diagnostics business using both capital and operating leases. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015 our diagnostics and genomics segment has approximately $15 million and $11 million, respectively, of lease receivables related to capital leases and approximately $23 million and $31 million, respectively, of net assets for operating leases.  We depreciate the assets related to the operating leases over their estimated useful lives.Capitalized software.    We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years once development is complete.Impairment of long-lived assets.    We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.Employee compensation and benefits.    Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $92 million and $86 million as of October 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.Foreign currency translation.    We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and was $5 million loss for fiscal year 2016, $9 million loss for 2015 and $4 million loss for 2014, respectively. 63Table of Contents            2.     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, to simplify accounting for deferred taxes.  Beginning on November 1, 2017 and including the interim periods following that date, we will be required to present all deferred tax balances as non-current.  Existing GAAP guidance requires us to record deferred tax balances as either current or non-current in accordance with the classification of the underlying attributes.  Early adoption of this guidance is permitted and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted this guidance at the end of the period ended April 30, 2016 prospectively and therefore, the October 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet reflects the new disclosure requirements but prior periods have not been adjusted.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments also remove the requirement to delay the recognition of an excess tax benefit until it reduces current taxes payable. Under the new guidance the benefit will be recorded when it arises with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings for previously unrecognized benefits. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2017. We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, on a retrospective basis.  The impact of adoption was the recognition of tax shortfalls of $2 million in our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes was the recognition of the windfall tax benefits as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings of $196 million together with an increase in deferred tax assets included in other assets of $98 million, an increase in additional paid in capital of $4 million, a reduction in other accrued liabilities of $1 million and a decrease of $99 million in other long term liabilities. There was no impact from minimum statutory withholding tax requirements to retained earnings as of November 1, 2015. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on the calculation of diluted weighted average shares. We elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares retrospectively to all periods presented. The presentation requirements for cash flows impacted our previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 as follows: Year Ended October 31, 2015 Year Ended October 31, 2014 As Reported As Adjusted As Reported As Adjusted (in millions)Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:       Net cash provided by operating activities$491 $512 $711 $731Net cash used in financing activities$(1,068) $(1,089) $(97) $(117)New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn April 2014, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on discontinued operations. The guidance changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization’s operations and financial results. Examples include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. Additionally, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, expenses of discontinued operations and of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for 64Table of Contents            discontinued operations reporting. The new guidance is effective for Agilent prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur after November 1, 2016.The disposal of  Keysight meets the definition of a discontinued operation under both the existing and amended accounting guidance.  The historical results of operations and the financial position of Keysight are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and are reported as discontinued operations within this Form 10-K.In May 2014, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition, Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of the amendments was to significantly enhance comparability and clarify principles of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. In July 2015, the FASB amended the effective date. In March 2016, the FASB clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB clarified certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance.  In May 2016, the FASB provided additional guidance related to disclosure of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments to guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.  The amendments are effective for us beginning fiscal 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for us beginning November 1, 2017.  The company expects to adopt this guidance on November 1, 2018.  We are currently in the assessment phase to determine the adoption method and are evaluating the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In April 2015, the FASB issued amendments to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.  The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs remain unchanged.  The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2016, and for interim periods within that year.  We do not expect the impact of adopting the amendments to be material on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify accounting for adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in connection with business combinations.   Beginning in November 1, 2017 and in the interim periods from November 1, 2018, adjustments will be recorded in the period that they are determined rather than applied retrospectively via revision to the period of acquisition and each period thereafter.   We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In January 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The provisions under this amendment are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is not permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2020, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted and we will be required to adopt using a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the timing of adoption and the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2016, the FASB issued amendments to simplify the transition to the equity method of accounting. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2017, and for interim periods within that year. We currently do not expect material impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2016, the FASB issued amendments to address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted.  If we decide to early adopt the amendments, we will be required to adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  We are evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact of the amendments on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect 65Table of Contents            adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  We are evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact of the amendments on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In November 2016, the FASB issued amendments to require amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2018, and for interim periods within that year.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact of the amendments on our consolidated statement of cash flows and disclosures.  Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.3.     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced its intention to separate its electronic measurement business, Keysight, which was previously a separate reportable segment, into a stand-alone publicly traded company.  Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013.   On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Keysight to Agilent stockholders, who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The separation agreement ensured that Keysight had approximately $700 million of total cash and cash equivalents immediately following distribution. For the year ended October 31, 2015, we transferred a total amount of cash and cash equivalents of $734 million to Keysight.  The historical results of operations and statement of financial position of Keysight have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and prior periods have been restated. Discontinued operations include results of Keysight's business except for certain allocated corporate overhead costs and certain costs associated with transition services provided by Agilent to Keysight. Discontinued operations also includes other costs incurred by Agilent to separate Keysight. These costs include transaction charges, advisory and consulting fees and information system expenses. The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of Keysight included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October 31,  2015 2014  (in millions)Net revenue$— $2,933 Costs and expenses39 2,521 Operating income (loss)(39) 412 Other income (expense), net— 5 Income (loss) from discontinued operations before tax(39) 417 Provision (benefit) for income taxes(2) 100 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations$(37) $317    Net income (loss) from discontinued operations includes transaction, information systems and other costs to effect the separation of $39 million and $178 million for the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the year ended October 31, 2015 only those costs incurred to effect the separation have been included. No income or expense has been recorded for the Keysight business after separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014.In addition, $332 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, primarily related to pension and other post-retirement benefits plans and currency translation was also transferred to Keysight together with $28 million of additional paid in capital related to share based compensation windfall tax benefits. The removal of Keysight net assets and equity related adjustments is presented as a reduction in Agilent's retained earnings and represents a non cash financing activity excluding cash 66Table of Contents            transferred. See Note 5 “Income Taxes” for tax implications and adjustments due to the distribution and Note 4 “Share Based Compensation” for changes to share based compensation awards as a result of the distribution of Keysight. Under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, we agreed to provide administrative, site services, information technology systems and various other corporate and support services to Keysight over the period of 12-18 months after the separation on a cost or cost-plus basis. The most significant component of the service income is the provision of IT services that was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2015. In total we recorded income for all services provided to Keysight of approximately $12 million in fiscal year 2015. In addition, Agilent expects to receive lease income together with site service income from Keysight over the next 3-4 years of approximately $12 million per year.  In the year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 other income (expense), net includes $12 million and $25 million of income in respect of the provision of services to, and lease income from Keysight. 4.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values.Description of Share-Based PlansEmployee stock purchase plan.    Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Agilent on November 1, or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 75 million shares.Under our ESPP, employees purchased 696,178 shares for $23 million in 2016, 346,472 shares for $12 million in 2015 and 1,604,406 shares for $73 million in 2014. As of October 31, 2016, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 45,168,192. Incentive compensation plans.    On November 19, 2008 and March 11, 2009, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the ""2009 Stock Plan"") to replace the Company's 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Stock Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and subsequently reserved 25 million shares of Company common stock that may be issued under the 2009 Plan, plus any shares forfeited or cancelled under the 1999 Stock Plan. The 2009 Stock Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (""SARs""), restricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2009 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2016, 10,316,082 shares were available for future awards under the 2009 Stock Plan.Stock options granted under the 2009 Stock Plans may be either ""incentive stock options"", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted.   No options were granted during the year ended October 31, 2016.Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program administered under the 2009 Stock Plan, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. Certain LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the Total Stockholders’ Return (“TSR”) set at the beginning of the performance period. Effective November 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved another type of performance stock award, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are also entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets based on Operating Margin (“OM”) over the three-year period are met.   All LTPP awards granted after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period.67Table of Contents            Based on the performance metrics the final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years and the maximum award value cannot exceed 300 percent of the grant date target value. We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met.We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant.In connection with the separation of Keysight Technologies on November 1, 2014 and in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement we made certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of our share-based compensation awards with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value of the awards prior to the separation. Exercisable and non-exercisable stock options converted to those of the entity where the employee is working post-separation. Restricted stock units awards and long-term performance plan grants were adjusted to provide holders restricted stock units and long-term performance plan grants in the company that employs such employee following the separation. These adjustments to our stock-based compensation awards did not have a material impact on compensation expense.Impact of Share-based Compensation AwardsWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Cost of products and services$14 $11 $13Research and development6 5 7Selling, general and administrative40 39 39Share-based compensation expense in continuing operations60 55 59Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations— — 39Total share-based compensation expense$60 $55 $98At October 31, 2016 and 2015 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory.  The weighted average grant date fair value of options, granted in 2015 and 2014 was $10.58 and $18.73 per share, respectively. No stock options were granted in 2016.Included in the 2016, 2015 and 2014 expense is incremental expense for acceleration of share-based compensation related to the announced workforce reduction plan of zero, $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Upon termination of the employees impacted by workforce reduction, the non-vested Agilent awards held by these employees immediately vests. Employees have a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. Valuation AssumptionsFor all periods presented, the fair value of share based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date.The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards and LTPP (OM) was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield and as appropriate, a discount related to the one-year post vesting. The compensation cost for LTPP (OM) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.68Table of Contents            The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and LTPP grants.  Years Ended October 31,  2016 2015 2014Stock Option Plans:      Weighted average risk-free interest rate — 1.75% 1.69%Dividend yield — 1% 1%Weighted average volatility — 28% 39%Expected life — 5.5 years 5.8 yearsLTPP:      Volatility of Agilent shares 24% 25% 36%Volatility of selected peer-company shares 14%-50% 12%-57% 13%-57%Price-wise correlation with selected peers 35% 37% 47%Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Due to the separation of Keysight on November 1, 2014, expected volatility for grants of options in 2015 was based on a 5.5 year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies.   For the volatility of our 2016 and 2015 LTPP (TSR) grants, we used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies.   We believe our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight is no longer relevant to use.   For the grants of options and LTPP (TSR) prior to November 1, 2014, the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of Agilent’s stock over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the stock options and LTPP (TSR).           All LTPP awards granted in 2016 to our senior management employees have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employee were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares. The model used the 3-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount. The grants made during 2016 have a discount of 5.5 percent while computing the fair value.69Table of Contents            Share-based Payment Award ActivityEmployee Stock OptionsThe following table summarizes employee stock option award activity of our employees and directors for 2016.  OptionsOutstanding  WeightedAverageExercise Price (in thousands)  Outstanding at October 31, 20155,712 $31Granted— $—Exercised(1,547) $25Cancelled/Forfeited/Expired(59) $33Outstanding at October 31, 20164,106 $33Forfeited and expired options from total cancellations in 2016 were as follows: OptionsCancelled WeightedAverageExercise Price (in thousands)  Forfeited31 $38Expired28 $28Total Options Cancelled during 201659 $33The options outstanding and exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October 31, 2016 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options ExercisableRange ofExercise PricesNumberOutstanding WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue NumberExercisable WeightedAverageRemainingContractualLife WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue (in thousands) (in years)   (in thousands) (in thousands) (in years)   (in thousands)$0 - 25361 2.4 $18 $9,268 361 2.4 $18 $9,268$25.01 - 301,633 5.0 $26 28,095 1,324 4.7 $26 22,741$30.01 - 40898 7.1 $39 3,995 439 7.1 $39 1,957$40.01 - over1,214 8.0 $41 3,259 302 8.0 $41 815 4,106 6.1 $33 $44,617 2,426 5.2 $29 $34,781The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $43.57 at October 31, 2016, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date.

The increase in net operating losses and 72Table of Contents            tax credits is due mainly to the early adoption of Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-09 “Improvements to Employees Share-Based Payment Accounting"". Agilent records U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2016 the Company recognized a $53 million deferred tax liability for the overall residual tax expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested. As of October 31, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested was $5.5 billion. No deferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the company’s foreign operations. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, the determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings is not practicable. In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify accounting for deferred taxes. Beginning on November 1, 2017 and including the interim periods following that date, we will be required to present all deferred tax balances as non-current. Prior GAAP guidance required us to record deferred tax balances as either current or non-current in accordance with the classification of the underlying attributes. Early adoption of this guidance was permitted and could be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted this guidance at the end of the period ended April 30, 2016 prospectively. Therefore, the October 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet reflects the new disclosure requirements but prior periods have not been adjusted.The breakdown between current and long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows for the years 2016 and 2015: October 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Current deferred tax assets (included within other current assets)$— $84Long-term deferred tax assets (included within other assets)386 180Current deferred tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities)— (10)Long-term deferred tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(65) (96)Total$321 $158Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2016, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $129 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is mainly related to deferred tax assets for California R&D credits, net operating losses in the Netherlands and capital losses in the U.S. and Australia.At October 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19 million and $142 million tax credit carryforwards. The federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2020 through 2034.  At October 31, 2016, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $200 million which expire in years beginning 2017 through 2033, if not utilized. In addition, we had net state tax credit carryforwards of $36 million that do not expire. All of the federal and some of the state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions.  At October 31, 2016, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $296 million. Of this foreign loss, $148 million will expire in years beginning 2017 through 2026, if not utilized. The remaining $148 million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules. These annual loss limitations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses.In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued amendments that change the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. Under the new guidance the benefit will be recorded when it arises with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings for previously unrecognized benefits. The new guidance is effective for us beginning November 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, on a retrospective basis, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of November 1, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The impact of adoption on previously reported quarterly results was the recognition of tax shortfalls of $2 million in our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes on previously reported quarterly results was the recognition of the windfall tax benefits as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings of $196 million together with an increase in deferred tax assets included in other assets of $98 million, an increase in additional paid in 73Table of Contents            capital of $4 million, a reduction in other accrued liabilities of $1 million and a decrease of $99 million in other long term liabilities.

The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. The tax holidays are due for renewal between 2018 and 2023. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $86 million, $65 million, and $27 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.26, $0.19, and $0.08 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.For 2016, the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 15.1%. The income tax expense from continuing operations was $82 million. The income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2016 included net discrete tax expense of $17 million. The net discrete tax expense for the year ended October 31, 2016 included $5 million of tax benefit for the extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit attributable to the company's prior fiscal year, $6 million of tax expense related to the curtailment gain recognized with respect to the U.S. retirement plan and Supplemental Benefits Plan, $18 million of tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on an equity method impairment that would generate a capital loss when realized, and a net $2 million of other discrete tax benefit. Included in the net $2 million discrete tax benefit are $9 million of out-of-period correcting tax expense entries recorded in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016 associated with German return-to-provision corrections. These are offset by an $11 million out-of-period correcting tax benefit associated with an adjustment to the deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings. The out-of-period corrections were determined to be immaterial to the previously issued and current period financial statements.For 2015, the company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 8.7 percent. The income tax expense from continuing operations was $42 million. The income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $55 million primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS) audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends. For 2014, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was (1.3) percent. The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $3 million. The income tax benefit for the year ended October 31, 2014 included a net discrete benefit of $33 million Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends.74Table of Contents            The breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows for the years 2016 and 2015: October 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Current income tax assets (included within other current assets)$83 $104Long-term income tax assets (included within other assets)19 20Current income tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities)(49) (62)Long-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities)(190) (227)Total$(137) $(165)The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.The aggregate changes in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Balance, beginning of year$289 $417 $512Additions for tax positions related to the current year31 33 45Additions for tax positions from prior years1 3 11Reductions for tax positions from prior years(27) (156) (141)Settlements with taxing authorities— (4) (2)Statute of limitations expirations(1) (4) (8)Balance, end of year$293 $289 $417As of October 31, 2016, we had $293 million of unrecognized tax benefits of which $271 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a tax expense of $2 million, a tax benefit of $2 million and a tax benefit $10 million of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $25 million and $24 million, respectively.On November 1, 2014, Agilent transferred deferred tax assets of $237 million, deferred tax liabilities of $37 million, current income tax payable of $40 million, and other long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling $8 million to Keysight as part of its separation from Agilent.  A current prepaid income tax asset of $19 million and long-term prepaid income tax asset of $3 million related to sales of intercompany assets was also transferred to Keysight upon separation from Agilent. In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. On September 22, 2015, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") for the tax years 2008 through 2011.  During the first quarter of 2016, we made a payment of approximately $9 million of tax plus interest as part of closing the exam.  This amount was partially offset by a prepaid tax account of approximately $3 million that the IRS allowed as an offset to the $12 million in incremental taxes. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $119 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  75Table of Contents            On January 29, 2014 we reached an agreement with the IRS for the tax years 2006 through 2007. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $111 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $75 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2001. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on December 1, 2015. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. The IRS notified the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on February 19, 2016 of its intent to appeal the Tax Court's decision in the case. We concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case.6.     NET INCOME PER SHAREThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below.  Years Ended October 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Numerator:     Income from continuing operations$462 $438 $232Income (loss) from discontinued operations$— $(37) $317Net income462 401 549Denominators:     Basic weighted average shares326 333 333Potential common shares — stock options and other employee stock plans3 2 5Diluted weighted average shares329 335 338In connection with the separation of Keysight on November 1, 2014 and in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement we made certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of our share-based compensation awards. These adjustments to our share-based awards did not have a material impact on our dilutive weighted average shares.The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. The total number of share-based awards issued in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 3 million, 3 million and 6 million, respectively.We exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, options to purchase 842,200, 1.2 million and 1,500 shares respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. In addition, we also exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive.  For the year ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, options to purchase 229,600, 368,900 and 383,200 shares respectively were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.76Table of Contents            7.     INVENTORY October 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Finished goods$339 $362Purchased parts and fabricated assemblies194 179Inventory$533 $541Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges, included in continuing operations, of $20 million were recorded in total cost of products in 2016, $30 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2014, respectively.

We have not included the pro forma impact of these acquisitions since they are not material to our current or prior period results. In 2016, we recorded additions to goodwill of $156 million and to other intangible assets of $121 million related to these acquisitions. During the year other intangible assets decreased $2 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. In 2015, we recorded additions to goodwill of $55 million and to intangible assets of $13 million related to a single acquisition of the company, Cartegenia. During the year other intangible assets decreased $58 million, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation. During 2015, we also removed the gross carrying amount of $246 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets which were no longer being used.In addition, we recorded $4 million, $3 million and $4 million of impairments of other intangibles related to the cancellation of in-process research and development projects during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.                                                                                                                           Amortization of intangible assets was $152 million in 2016, $156 million in 2015, and $189 million in 2014.

Approximately $80 million relates to our variable interest entity investment, see Note 1, ""Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"". Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company’s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividend paid.All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. During the year ended October 31, 2016, we have identified certain events and circumstances that indicates the decline in value of an equity method investment is other-than-temporary.  As a result, we have written down the investment to its fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of approximately $18 million.Amounts included in other income (expense), net for the appropriate share of loss on equity method investments and other than temporary impairments were as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Equity method investments - share of losses$(10) $(9) $(7)Equity method investments - other than temporary impairments (18) — —Total$(28) $(9) $(7)Net unrealized gains on our trading securities portfolio were $1 million in 2016, $2 million in 2015 and $2 million in 2014.11.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.Fair Value HierarchyThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level 1 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.79Table of Contents            Level 2 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2016 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement atOctober 31, 2016 Using October 31, 2016 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,482 $1,482 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)9 — 9 —Long-term       Trading securities31 31 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,522 $1,513 $9 $—Liabilities:       Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$8 $— $8 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability31 — 31 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$39 $— $39 $—80Table of Contents            Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2015 were as follows:   Fair Value Measurement atOctober 31, 2015 Using October 31, 2015 Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) (in millions)Assets:       Short-term       Cash equivalents (money market funds)$1,411 $1,411 $— $—Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)4 — 4 —Long-term       Trading securities35 35 — —Total assets measured at fair value$1,450 $1,446 $4 $—Liabilities:      Short-term       Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts)$5 $— $5 $—Long-term       Deferred compensation liability35 — 35 —Total liabilities measured at fair value$40 $— $40 $—Our money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable.Trading securities and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring BasisLong-Lived AssetsFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Years EndedOctober 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Long-lived assets held and used$4 $3 $23Long-lived assets held for sale$— $— $—Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $4 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $4 million, which was included in net income for 2016. Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $3 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $3 million, which was included in net income for 2015. Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $23 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $23 million, which was included in net income for 2014. 81Table of Contents            The impairment charge in 2016 and 2015 of $4 million and $3 million, respectively, relates to IPR&D projects that were abandoned and written down to their fair value of zero. The impairment charge in 2014 includes $19 million relating to the exit of a business and $4 million related to various IPR&D projects that were abandoned and written down to their fair value of zero.There were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets were measured using level 2 inputs.12.   DERIVATIVESWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options, and interest rate swaps, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.Fair Value HedgesWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. The fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and, in the past, we have used interest rate swaps to change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short term investments. As of October 31, 2016, all interest rate swap contracts had either been terminated or had expired. On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. On October 20, 2014 we prepaid $500 million out of $600 million principal of our 2017 senior notes and fully amortized the associated proportionate deferred gain to other income (expense).  The remaining gain to be amortized related to the $100 million of 2017 senior notes at October 31, 2016 was $1 million. On August 9, 2011, we terminated five interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The gain to be amortized at October 31, 2016 was $15 million. All deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective senior notes.  Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to other income (expense) in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in other income (expense) over the life of the option contract. Ineffectiveness in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was not significant. For the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 gains and losses recognized in earnings due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. In July 2012, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2022 senior notes issued on September 10, 2012.  We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 10, 2012 and we recognized a deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 senior notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2016 was $2 million. 82Table of Contents            In February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2016 was $9 million. Other HedgesAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.Our use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.A number of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. The counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization, in accordance with derivative agreements, on derivative instruments in net liability positions.The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2016, was $4 million. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2016.There were 46 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2016 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 165 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2016 not designated as hedging instruments.

Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees.Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the ""RP""), defined benefits which are based on an employee's base or target pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plans is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the ""DPSP""), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. Effective November 1, 2014, Agilent’s U.S. defined benefit retirement plan is closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires. As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen.  See Plan Amendments below.As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $157 million and $169 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.84Table of Contents            In addition to the DPSP, in the U.S., Agilent maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""SBRP""), supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the ""U.S. Plans"" in the tables below.Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements.401(k) defined contribution plan.    Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan.  During the six months ended April 30, 2016, we provided matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation.  Effective May 1, 2016, we provide matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation and an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen.  The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. Post-retirement medical benefit plans.    In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. Eligible retirees who were less than age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for a fixed amount which can be utilized to pay for either sponsored plans and/or individual medicare plans. Effective January 1, 2012, employees who were at least age 50 as of January 1, 2005 and who retire after age 55 with 15 or more years of service are eligible for fixed dollar subsidies and stipends. Grandfathered retirees receive a fixed monthly subsidy toward pre-65 premium costs (subsidy capped at 2011 levels) and a fixed monthly stipend post-65. The subsidy amounts will not increase. In addition, any new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the retiree medical plans upon retiring. Current eligible employees will continue to participate in the retiree medical program in place as of November 1, 2014.  Retirees will maintain the retiree medical benefits they are eligible for as of November 1, 2014.  As of April 30, 2016, benefits under this plan were changed - see Plan Amendments below.Plan Amendments. In 2016, we made changes to our U.S. Retirement Plan and Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (""U.S. Plans"").  Effective April 30, 2016, benefit accruals under the U.S. Plans were frozen.  Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016 remained fully vested, and there were no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016.  In addition, active employees who have not met the eligibility requirement for the Retiree Medical Account (RMA) under the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan - 55 years old with at least 15 years of Agilent service - as of April 30, 2016 - will only be eligible for 50 percent of the current RMA reimbursement amount upon retirement.Due to these plan amendments, we recorded a curtailment gain of $15 million in the U.S. Plans during the year ended October 31, 2016. In addition, we recognized a settlement gain of $1 million related to the U.S. Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan during the year ended October 31, 2016.85Table of Contents            Components of net periodic cost.    The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.

The plans are composed of (a) a substitutional portion based on the pay-related part of the old-age pension benefits prescribed by JWPIL (similar to social security benefits in the United States) and (b) a corporate portion based on a contributory defined benefit pension arrangement established at the discretion of the company.   As required by law, Agilent will disburse the substitutional portion of Agilent’s plans to the government.   In December 2016, Agilent has received approval from the Japanese government to disburse the substitutional portion of Agilent’s plans, equal to $27 million.   We anticipate that Agilent will recognize a settlement gain in the first quarter of 2017 on the payment of the substitutional portion.87Table of Contents            In connection with the separation of Keysight Technologies on November 1, 2014, Agilent transferred certain liabilities and assets of the U.S. and Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans to similar plans created for Keysight Technologies employees.

Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately, 5 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 37 to 60 percent to equities, from 40 to 60 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 6 percent to real estate investments and from zero to 7 percent to cash, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2016 and 2015 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds.Fair Value.    The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 11, ""Fair Value Measurements"".Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments except when the cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds, which have a daily net value derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 2 investments.Equity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 2 investments.  Commingled funds which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.Fixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 2 investments.  Commingled funds which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments.88Table of Contents            Other Investments - Other investments includes property based pooled vehicles which invest in real estate. Market net asset values are regularly published in the financial press or on corporate websites and so these investments are classified as Level 2. Other investments also includes partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3.The following tables present the fair value of U.S. Defined Benefit Plans assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value

$26 million to the U.S. defined benefit plans, $20 million to plans outside the U.S., and zero to the Post-Retirement Medical Plans. The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years: U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans Non-U.S. DefinedBenefit Plans U.S. Post-RetirementBenefit Plans (in millions)2017$27 $48 $82018$25 $22 $82019$26 $24 $82020$28 $25 $72021$27 $27 $72022 - 2026$137 $168 $35Assumptions.    The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2016 and 2015, were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally 92Table of Contents            based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2016 2015 2014U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate4.20% 4.00% 4.00-4.50%Average increase in compensation levels3.50% 3.50% 3.50%Expected long-term return on assets7.50% 8.00% 8.00%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:     Discount rate0.77-3.76% 1.50-4.00% 1.50-4.50%Average increase in compensation levels2.25-4.00% 2.50-3.25% 2.50-3.25%Expected long-term return on assets4.25-6.50% 4.00-6.50% 4.00-6.50%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:     Discount rate4.00% 4.00% 4.00-4.25%Expected long-term return on assets7.50% 8.00% 8.00%Current medical cost trend rate7.00% 8.00% 8.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2028 2028Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: As of the Years Ending October 31, 2016 2015U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate3.75% 4.20%Average increase in compensation levelsN/A 3.50%Non-U.S. defined benefit plans:   Discount rate0.40-2.62% 0.77-3.76%Average increase in compensation levels2.00-4.25% 2.25-4.00%U.S. post-retirement benefits plans:   Discount rate3.50% 4.00%Current medical cost trend rate6.00% 7.00%Ultimate medical cost trend rate3.50% 3.50%Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year2029 2029Health care trend rates do not have a significant effect on the total service and interest cost components or on the post-retirement benefit obligation amounts reported for the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan for the year ended October 31, 2016.14.   GUARANTEESStandard WarrantyWe accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend between one and three years from the date of delivery, depending on the product.93Table of Contents            A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities. October 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Balance as of October 31, 2015 and 2014$31 $30Accruals for warranties including change in estimates53 53Settlements made during the period(49) (52)Balance as of October 31, 2016 and 2015$35 $31Accruals for warranties due within one year34 29Accruals for warranties due after one year1 2Balance as of October 31, 2016 and 2015$35 $31Indemnifications in Connection with TransactionsIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future.  These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction.  In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2016.  Indemnifications to Officers and DirectorsOur corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2016.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2016.In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2016.94Table of Contents            15.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOperating Lease Commitments:    We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at October 31, 2016 were $38 million for 2017, $35 million for 2018, $25 million for 2019, $14 million for 2020, $8 million for 2021 and $26 million thereafter. Future minimum lease income under leases at October 31, 2016 was $11 million for 2017, $10 million for 2018, $9 million for 2019, and $19 million thereafter. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense was $61 million in 2016, $65 million in 2015 and $55 million in 2014.Contingencies:     We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.16.   SHORT-TERM DEBTCredit FacilitiesOn September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $700 million. For the year ended October 31, 2016, we borrowed $255 million and repaid $255 million by October 31, 2016.  As of October 31, 2016, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.

The 2017 senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November 1, 2017, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on May 1st and November 1st of each year and payments commenced on May 1, 2008.On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination was approximately $43 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2016 was $1 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2017 senior notes.95Table of Contents            On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes due November 1, 2017 that had been called for redemption on September 19, 2014. The redemption price of approximately $580 million included a $80 million prepayment penalty computed in accordance with the terms of the 2017 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest related to $500 million partial redemption.  The prepayment penalty less partial amortization of previously deferred interest rate swap gain of approximately $14 million together with $2 million of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount was disclosed in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. We also paid accrued and unpaid interest of $15 million on the 2017 senior notes up to but not including the redemption date. 2020 Senior NotesIn July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (""2020 senior notes"").

The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2016 was $9 million. Other debtIn  2016, we paid approximately $37 million of our mortgage debt, secured on buildings in Denmark, to a Danish financial institution.   The gain recognized upon early payment was not material. No balance exists on this debt as of October 31. 2016.96Table of Contents            18.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYStock Repurchase Program On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The program was designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. For the year ended October 31, 2016, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $98 million, which completed the purchases under this authorization.   For the year ended October 31, 2015 we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for $267 million. For the year ended October 31, 2014 we repurchased 4 million shares for $200 million. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the ""2015 repurchase program""). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock through and including November 1, 2018.  The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  During the year ended October 31, 2016, upon the completion of our previous repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for $336 million under this authorization. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.  As of October 31, 2016, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $804 million of our common stock under this program.In the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for  $111 million under the 2015 repurchase program.  In addition, we retired  292.5 million treasury shares at an aggregate cost of $10.6 billion, which represents all our previously repurchased shares over the past 11 years and our November 2016 repurchases. Also the retirement resulted in a decrease of $6.7 billion to retained earnings and a decrease of $3.9 billion to additional paid-in-capital.Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock During the year ended October 31, 2016, cash dividends of $0.46 per share, or $150 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2015, cash dividends of $0.40 per share, or $133 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2014, cash dividends of $0.53 per share, or $176 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. On November 16, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.132 per share of common stock, or approximately $43 million which will be paid on January 25, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2017. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)The following table summarizes the components of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, net of tax effect: October 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Foreign currency translation, net of tax expense of $(5) and $(2) for 2016 and 2015, respectively(197) (189)Unrealized losses on defined benefit plans, net of tax benefit of $176 and $126 for 2016 and 2015, respectively(305) (204)Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax (expense) benefit of $2 and $(2) for 2016 and 2015, respectively(1) 2Total accumulated other comprehensive loss$(503) $(391)97Table of Contents            Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component and related tax effects for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions):      Net defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs      Unrealized gain on investments Foreign currency translation Prior service credits Actuarial Losses Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives Total  (in millions)As of October 31, 2014 $17 $156 $255 $(771) $9 $(334)Transfer to Keysight (17) (9) (83) 444 (3) 332Balance after transfer to Keysight — 147 172 (327) 6 (2)             Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications — (360) — (90) 11 (439)             Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income — — (17) 35 (18) —             Tax benefit — 24 6 17 3 50             Other comprehensive loss — (336) (11) (38) (4) (389)             As of October 31, 2015 $— $(189) $161 $(365) $2 $(391)             Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications — (5) 6 (171) (10) (180)             Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income — — (29) 43 3 17             Tax (expense) benefit — (3) 8 42 4 51             Other comprehensive loss — (8) (15) (86) (3) (112)             As of October 31, 2016 $— $(197) $146 $(451) $(1) $(503)             98Table of Contents            Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions): Details about accumulated otherAmounts ReclassifiedAffected line item incomprehensive income componentsfrom other comprehensive incomestatement of operations20162015Unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives(3)18 Cost of products(3)18Total before income tax—(6) (Provision)/benefit for income tax(3)12Total net of income taxNet defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs:Actuarial net loss(43)(35)Prior service benefit2917(14)(18)Total before income tax45 (Provision)/benefit for income tax(10)(13)Total net of income taxTotal reclassifications for the period$(13)$(1)Amounts in parentheses indicate reductions to income and increases to other comprehensive income.Reclassifications of prior service benefit and actuarial net loss in respect of retirement plans and post retirement pension plans are included in the computation of net periodic cost (see Note 13 ""Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans"").19.   SEGMENT INFORMATIONDescription of segments.  We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. In the first fiscal quarter of 2015, we completed the separation of our electronic measurement business. See Note 3, ""Discontinued Operations"" for further information. Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (""LC"") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (""LCMS"") systems; gas chromatography (""GC"") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (""GCMS"") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (""ICP-MS"") instruments; atomic absorption (""AA"") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (“MP-AES”) instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (""ICP-99Table of Contents            OES"") instruments; cell analysis plate based assays; laboratory software and informatics systems; laboratory automation; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of five areas of activity providing solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (""NGS"") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (""GMP"") conditions for use as active pharmaceutical ingredients (""API"") in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Next, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings to cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), in situ hybridization (“ISH”), hematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) staining and special staining. We also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Finally, the reagent partnership business is a provider of reagents used for turbidimetry and flow cytometry. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.  The majority of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices.  Solutions range from chemistries and supplies to services and software helping to connect the entire lab.  Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies.  Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, as well as asset management and consultative services that help increase customer productivity.  Custom service and consumable bundles are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements.A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, other corporate infrastructure expenses and costs of centralized research and development. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. Corporate charges previously allocated to our electronic measurement business, but not classified within discontinued operations, were not reallocated to our other segments. These charges are presented below as a component of the reconciliation between segments' income from operations and Agilent's income from continuing operations and are classified as unallocated corporate charges. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring and transformational expenses, acquisition and integration costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments.The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.100Table of Contents            The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab TotalSegments (in millions)Year ended October 31, 2016:       Total net revenue$2,073 $709 $1,420 $4,202Income from operations$429 $114 $316 $859Depreciation expense$36 $31 $28 $95Share-based compensation expense$29 $10 $21 $60Year ended October 31, 2015:       Total net revenue$2,046 $662 $1,330 $4,038Income from operations$380 $88 $299 $767Depreciation expense$27 $37 $34 $98Share-based compensation expense$27 $9 $18 $54Year ended October 31, 2014:       Total net revenue$2,078 $663 $1,307 $4,048Income from operations$369 $93 $301 $763Depreciation expense$29 $43 $33 $105Share-based compensation expense$29 $9 $18 $56For the year ended October 31, 2014, depreciation expense and share-based compensation expense excludes unallocated corporate charges.The following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Total reportable segments' income from operations$859 $767 $763Restructuring and business exit related costs(11) (12) (66)Asset Impairments(4) (3) (4)Transformational programs(38) (56) (29)Amortization of intangibles(152) (156) (189)Acquisition and integration costs(41) (13) (11)Acceleration of share-based compensation expense related to workforce reduction— (2) (1)One-time and pre-separation costs— — (14)Pension curtailment gain16 — —Impairment of loans(7) — —Other(7) (3) 10Interest Income11 7 9Interest Expense(72) (66) (110)Other income (expense), net(10) 17 (89)Unallocated corporate charges— — (40)Income before taxes, as reported$544 $480 $229Major customers.    No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014.101Table of Contents            The following table presents assets and capital expenditures directly managed by each segment.

As a result of that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2016 based on criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingDuring the year ended October 31, 2015, management identified certain errors in the tax accounts, primarily related to prior years, and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for income taxes. To remediate the material weakness described above, during fiscal 2016, we designed and implemented additional rigorous reviews and other controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to validate the inputs and outputs for the significant tax accounting processes, as well as enhancing the tax accounting expertise within the tax function.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the controls were operating effectively and have concluded that the material weakness has been remediated.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during Agilent's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",>Item 9B.    Other InformationNone.PART III,">Item 10.

5,,">Item 1A. Risk Factors. Howmet’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Howmet or that Howmet currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company in future periods.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsOur business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.Any outbreaks of contagious diseases, public health epidemics or pandemics and other adverse public health developments in countries where we, our employees, customers and suppliers operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the global community, including the United States, Europe and South America, is adversely impacting our operations, and the nature and extent of the impact over time is highly uncertain and beyond our control. The extent to which COVID-19 further affects our operations over time will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the duration of the pandemic, the continued severity of the virus, resurgences and emergence of variants of the virus, the efficacy and availability of vaccines, and the extent of actions that may be taken to contain its impact. These actions include, but are not limited to, declarations of states of emergency, business closures, manufacturing restrictions and a prolonged period of travel, commercial and/or other similar restrictions and limitations, many of which have been implemented across much of the globe and all of which have negatively affected our business. The longer the duration, the greater the impact on our business and the more heightened the risk of a continuing material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or cash flows, as well as on our business strategies and initiatives. We continue to monitor guidelines proposed by federal, state and local, as well as foreign, governments with respect to measures for continued operation, which may change over time depending on public health, safety and other considerations. We are continuing to focus on the safety and protection of our workforce by continuing to implement additional safety protocols in light of COVID-19.As a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain its spread, our global sales, including to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries that are impacted by COVID-19, have been and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted due to the disruption in demand, which has had and over time could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below:•Business and operations risks: We continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to COVID-19 to determine whether we will need to significantly modify our business practices or take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. We have had a number of smaller manufacturing locations that have experienced periods of shutdowns. Future shutdowns will be dependent on facts and circumstances as they unfold, including based on the restrictions and limitations noted above. Additional shutdowns, while not required by governmental authorities, may be necessary to match our production to the reduced demand of our customers. In addition, due to the foregoing factors and potential further disruptions, we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase. We may also face challenges in restoring our production levels if and when COVID-19 abates, including as a result of government-imposed or other limitations that prevent the return of all or a portion of our workforce, continue to disrupt demand and/or limit the capabilities of our suppliers. As a result of COVID-19 and its potential impact on the aerospace industry, the possibility exists that a sustained impact to our operations, financial results and market capitalization may require material impairments of our assets, including, but not limited to, goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets, and right-of-use assets. While we have already implemented plans to reduce costs, including certain headcount reductions, reductions in certain cash outflows, suspension of our common stock dividend and reductions in the levels of our capital expenditures, the longer-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, but could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.•Customer and supplier risks: We have limited visibility into future demand due to the disruptions resulting from COVID-19. The sharp decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that governments and private organizations worldwide have implemented in an attempt to contain its spread is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, airlines and airframers and their respective demand for our customers’ products and services. Aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and, as a result, demand for products in the OEM market has significantly decreased. Several of our aerospace and commercial transportation customers temporarily suspended operations at certain production sites, 11Table of Contentsreduced operations and production rates, and/or took cost-cutting actions, including, but not limited to, General Electric Company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation and The Boeing Company, which represented approximately 11%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our third-party sales in 2020. Due to the foregoing factors and other cost-cutting measures, we are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products, customer requests for potential payment deferrals, pricing concessions or other contract modifications, and delays in deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones. COVID-19 may also limit the ability of our counterparties generally to perform their obligations to us, including, but not limited to, our customers’ ability to make timely payments to us. These trends may lead to charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts over time, as noted above, as we have historically depended upon the strength of these industries, particularly the commercial aerospace industry. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact customer contract negotiations, including the ability to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations and our ability to obtain new customers. Similarly, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. To date, we have not experienced significant disruption to our supply chain. If our suppliers’ operations were to be impacted, we may need to seek alternate suppliers, which may be more expensive, may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers, each of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The duration of the current disruptions to our customers and to our supply chain, and related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Ultimately, the demand for our products is, in turn, driven by demand for transportation and for people to travel within and between various countries. Should the COVID-19 pandemic cause a long-term deterioration in demand for transportation or travel due to fear or anxiety related to health concerns, governmental restriction, economic hardships, or increased use of electronic communication technologies embraced during the COVID-19 related shutdowns, the effects on our business may extend well beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis and immediate related governmental actions.•Market risks: The current financial market dynamics and volatility pose heightened risks to our liquidity. For example, dramatically lower interest rates and lower expected asset valuations and returns can materially impact the calculation of long-term liabilities such as our pension. In addition, extreme volatility in financial markets has had and may continue to have adverse impacts on other asset valuations such as the value of the investment portfolios supporting our pension. Our long-term liabilities are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that can move in offsetting directions and should be considered as of the time of a relevant measurement event.•Liquidity and credit risks: We currently have the ability to borrow up to $1.0 billion under our Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which was amended in June 2020. A prolonged period of generating lower financial results and cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition, including in respect of satisfying both required and voluntary pension funding requirements, could result in potential increases in net debt or reductions in EBITDA, and could otherwise negatively affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. If the foregoing or other factors negatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the Credit Agreement, our ability to draw under the Credit Agreement would be adversely affected. There can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades as a result of weaker than anticipated performance of our business or other factors, including overall market conditions. Rating downgrades could further adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our business. Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding (including for receivables securitization or supply chain finance programs used to finance working capital) or our ability to refinance certain of our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Although the U.S. federal and other governments have announced a number of funding programs to support businesses, our ability or willingness to access funding under such programs may be limited by regulations or other guidance, including eligibility criteria, or by further change or uncertainty related to the terms of these programs.The COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed herein, including, but not limited to, risks related to global economic conditions, competition, loss of customers, costs of supplies, manufacturing difficulties and disruptions, investment returns, our credit profile, our credit ratings and interest rates. We expect that the longer the period of disruption from COVID-19 continues, the more material the adverse impact will be on our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and/or cash flows. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or cash flows.The markets for Howmet’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.12Table of ContentsHowmet is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Howmet sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace and commercial transportation industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control.In particular, Howmet derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft and spare parts. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft and spare parts is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators, the retirement of older aircraft, the performance and cost of alternative materials, and technological improvements to aircraft. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global geopolitical environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older military aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines.Further, the demand for Howmet’s commercial transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by commercial transportation and automotive manufacturers. Commercial transportation and automotive sales and production are affected by many factors, including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and levels of competition. The automotive industry is also sensitive to general economic conditions, including credit markets and interest rates, and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage, vehicle size, configuration and features. Howmet is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government actions. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Howmet could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety, which could adversely affect Howmet’s reputation, business and financial statements.The manufacture of many of Howmet’s products is a highly exacting and complex process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols, specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, problems with raw materials, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, labor unrest and environmental factors. Such problems could have an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance. Product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure. Because of approval, license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to Howmet or its customers. Accordingly, manufacturing problems, product defects or other risks associated with our products, could result in significant costs to and liability for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages, fines or penalties, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.A material disruption of Howmet’s operations, particularly at one or more of its manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect Howmet’s business.If Howmet’s operations, particularly one of its key manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, theft, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes or other reasons, Howmet may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers, which could adversely affect Howmet’s financial performance.Interruptions in production could increase Howmet’s costs and reduce its sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to incur costs for premium freight, make substantial capital expenditures, or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect Howmet’s profitability and financial condition. Furthermore, a delivery delay by us due to production interruptions could subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer. Howmet maintains property damage insurance that the Company believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under Howmet’s insurance policies may not offset the lost profits or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect Howmet’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 13Table of ContentsInformation technology system failures, cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Howmet’s intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Howmet relies on its information technology systems to manage and operate its business, process transactions, and summarize its operating results. Howmet’s information technology systems could be subject to damage or interruption from power outages; computer, network and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism; and usage errors by employees. If Howmet’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and Howmet may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material disruption in the Company’s information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Howmet also faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches.The Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Howmet’s financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Howmet employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks, including technical security controls, data encryption, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, anti-virus software and frequent backups. Additionally, the Company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information, which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use the Company’s systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Howmet’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and could result in the diminution of the value of the Company’s investment in research and development.Howmet’s enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from cyber attacks and security breaches. Howmet also maintains compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber attack or security breach.However, a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around the Company’s cybersecurity environment may prevent Howmet from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or the market price of its securities.Howmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial portion of raw materials essential to our operations, and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.Howmet has supply arrangements with a limited number of suppliers for raw materials. We maintain annual or long-term contracts for a majority of our supply requirements, and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, or obtain replacements for, any of our long-term contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all.From time to time, increasing demand levels have caused regional supply constraints in the industry and further increases in demand levels could exacerbate these issues. Such constraints could impact our production or force us to purchase primary metal and other supplies from alternative sources, which may not be available in sufficient quantities or on terms that are favorable to us. Howmet could also have exposure if a key supplier is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis. In addition, a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key supplier exposes us to the risk of default by the supplier on its contractual agreement, and this risk is increased by weak and deteriorating economic conditions on a global, regional or industry sector level. Any of the foregoing supply chain disruptions or those due to capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, cyber attacks, delivery issues or disruptions due to weather-related, natural disaster, or pandemic events could adversely affect Howmet’s operations and profitability.14Table of ContentsHowmet’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost or volatility in the availability of raw materials.Howmet may be adversely affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials (including, but not limited to, nickel, titanium, aluminum, cobalt, vanadium and platinum), as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Howmet’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions, changes in geopolitical conditions or regulatory requirements (such as human rights regulations or environmental regulations), labor relations between the producers and their work forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, sanctions, new or increased import duties, countervailing or anti-dumping duties, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. In addition, from time to time, commodity prices may fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve, which may cause periodic supply interruptions. Howmet may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s operating results.Howmet could be adversely affected by the loss of key customers or significant changes in the business or financial condition of its customers.Howmet has long-term contracts with a significant number of its customers, some of which are subject to renewal, renegotiation or re-pricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions. Howmet’s failure to successfully renew, renegotiate or favorably re-price such agreements, or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships, could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue.Additionally, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by Howmet could affect Howmet’s financial results. Howmet’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their businesses. For example, due to the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft by regulatory authorities in March 2019, Boeing suspended production of the aircraft in January 2020 and resumed low-rate production in May 2020, which has resulted in a reduction in the Company’s sales. While regulatory authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions lifted grounding orders beginning in late 2020, our sales could continue to be negatively affected from the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding.Howmet’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Howmet, including to reduce the amount of Howmet’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers. If Howmet’s customers reduce, terminate or delay purchases from Howmet due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and Howmet is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.Howmet could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending.Howmet’s products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft. Although many of the programs in which Howmet participates extend several years, they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations. Changes in military strategy, policy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for Howmet’s products, which could adversely affect Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Howmet may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business, or complete projects, at the levels, projected costs or by the dates targeted.From time to time, Howmet may announce future targets or goals for its business, including revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, restructuring plans, cost reductions and improvements in profitability. Future targets and goals reflect the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and are based on the Company’s then current expectations, its perception of historical trends, and estimates and projections about the environment, economies and markets in which Howmet operates, as well as other applicable factors. As such, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. The actual outcome may be materially different. Failure by the Company to achieve the targets or goals at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all, may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.In addition, the implementation of Howmet’s business strategy may involve the entry into and the execution of complex projects, which place significant demands on the Company’s management and personnel, and may depend on numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. There can be no assurance that such projects will be completed within budgeted costs, on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to the risks described in this report, or other factors. The failure to complete a material project as planned, or a significant delay in its execution, could have an adverse effect on Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Howmet faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.  15Table of ContentsAs discussed in Part I, Item 1 (Business-Competitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for Howmet’s products are highly competitive. Howmet’s competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in our product markets. New product offerings, new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace Howmet products. The willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Howmet, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for Howmet’s products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Howmet’s competitors or customers could adversely affect Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, Howmet may face increased competition due to industry consolidation. As companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or merged. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of Howmet’s business may acquire or form alliances with Howmet’s competitors, thereby reducing their business with Howmet. Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. Consolidation within Howmet’s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect Howmet’s profitability. Moreover, if, as a result of increased leverage, customers require Howmet to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished, Howmet could decide not to sell certain products to a particular customer, or not to sell certain products at all, which would decrease Howmet’s revenue and could benefit its competitors. Consolidation within Howmet’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for Howmet’s products if a combined entity replaces Howmet’s products with those of Howmet’s competitors with which it has prior relationships. The result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business, operating results and financial condition.Howmet may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully.Howmet’s competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to:•identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in Howmet’s end markets;•identify and successfully execute on a strategy to remain an essential and sustainable element of our customers’ supply chains;•fund, develop, manufacture and bring innovative new products to market quickly and cost-effectively;•monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers’ and competitors’ abilities to deploy such technologies; and•achieve sufficient return on investment for new products based on capital expenditures and research and development spending.Howmet is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects, including advanced alloy development, engineered product design, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. While Howmet intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors, including those developing technology to displace Howmet’s current products. In addition, Howmet may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages. There can be no assurance that any of Howmet’s new products, development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or be beneficial to Howmet.Howmet’s business depends, in part, on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations, reductions and delays.Howmet is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation, military aircraft and aircraft engine programs. Many of these contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years. If Howmet fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, program cancellations, reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersProduct liability, product safety, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims and investigations may materially affect Howmet’s financial condition and damage its reputation.The manufacture and sale of our products expose Howmet to potential product liability, personal injury, property damage and related claims. These claims may arise from allegations of failure to meet product specifications, product design flaws and malfunction of products, as well as from misuse of our products, use of our products in an unintended, unapproved or unrecommended manner, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us. New data and information, including information about the ways in which Howmet’s products are used, may lead Howmet, regulatory authorities, government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations, or impose restrictions, related to the manufacturing or use of Howmet’s products.16Table of ContentsIn the event that a Howmet product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, Howmet may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. In addition, if a Howmet product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, Howmet’s sales could decrease, its reputation could be adversely impacted and it could be subject to further liability claims. Moreover, events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose Howmet to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions.There can be no assurance that Howmet will be successful in defending any such proceedings or that insurance available to Howmet will be sufficient to cover any losses associated with such proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could: (i) have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business, financial condition or profitability; (ii) impose substantial monetary damages and/or non-monetary penalties; (iii) result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations or other proceedings involving Howmet; (iv) result in loss of customers; (v) require changes to our products or business operations; or (vi) damage Howmet’s reputation and/or negatively impact the market price of Howmet’s common stock. Even if Howmet successfully defends against these types of claims, Howmet could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims; Howmet’s management could be required to devote significant time, attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims and responding to these investigations; and Howmet’s reputation could suffer. Product liability claims and related lawsuits and investigations, product recalls, and allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business, financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to U.S. and foreign governments and their respective agencies, as a subcontractor of their prime contractors. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.Howmet’s global operations expose Howmet to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the market price of its securities.Howmet has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. As a result, Howmet’s global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which Howmet does business, as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, including:•economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers (including tariffs imposed by the United States as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China or other foreign entities), taxation, data privacy, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of assets or earnings;•geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements;•war, terrorist activities, kidnapping of personnel or other dangerous conditions;•major public health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, coronavirus (including COVID-19), and the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Howmet’s operations, workforce, supply chain or end markets;•difficulties enforcing contractual rights and intellectual property, including a lack of remedies for misappropriation in certain jurisdictions;•changes in trade and tax laws that may result in our customers being subjected to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and reduce their willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products;•compliance with antitrust and competition regulations;•rising labor costs or labor unrest, including strikes;•compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements as compared to U.S. laws;•aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by foreign governmental authorities;•compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and corruption laws;17Table of Contents•compliance with U.S. laws concerning trade, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control;•imposition of currency controls; and•adverse tax audit rulings.Although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Howmet’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company’s international operations subject Howmet to complex and dynamic laws and regulations that, in some cases, could result in conflict or inconsistency between applicable laws of different jurisdictions and/or legal obligations. While Howmet believes it has adopted appropriate risk management, compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the associated risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs, penalties, liabilities or other potential risks such as loss of export privileges or repatriation of assets that may arise from such events.Howmet may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business and competitive position.Howmet owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining Howmet’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Howmet’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Howmet’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents Howmet owns or licenses. Despite its controls and safeguards, Howmet’s technology may be misappropriated by its employees, its competitors or other third parties. The pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of Howmet intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. Further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of Howmet intellectual property increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against Howmet relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce Howmet’s rights sufficiently, could adversely affect Howmet’s business and competitive position.Howmet may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.Howmet’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Howmet. The Company may experience an unfavorable change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies.Howmet is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks in the United States and abroad in connection with its business and products. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, product testing, health and safety, environmental matters, employment matters, required record keeping and record retention, compliance with securities laws, intellectual property rights, government contracts and taxes, insurance or commercial matters, as well as compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing import and export, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, sales and trading practices, human rights and modern slavery, sourcing of raw materials, third-party relationships, supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products. Howmet may be a party to litigation in a foreign jurisdiction where geopolitical risks might influence the ultimate outcome of such litigation. Howmet could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.The global and diverse nature of Howmet’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. While Howmet believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. Litigation and compliance efforts may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Unanticipated changes in Howmet’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Howmet’s future profitability.18Table of ContentsHowmet is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Company’s tax expense and profitability. Howmet’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.Corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. In particular, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 Act. Those guidance projects, which include both Proposed and Final Treasury Regulations, continued into 2020. Howmet continues to review the ongoing interpretive guidance and evaluate its consequences. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Act may differ from reported amounts due to, among other things, changes resulting from such ongoing guidance. Further, we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Act or enact alternative legislation by the new presidential administration or Congress.Labor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.A significant portion of Howmet’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see “Employees” in Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this report. While Howmet previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions, Howmet may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Howmet’s facilities in the future. Howmet may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Howmet is subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on Howmet’s business results.Howmet is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), state and local wage laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and regulations related to safety, discrimination, organizing, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments, citizenship requirements, and healthcare insurance mandates. Allegations that Howmet has violated such laws or regulations could damage the Company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which could have a material adverse impact on Howmet’s operations and financial condition.Howmet is exposed to environmental, health and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities.Howmet’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including present, past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that 19Table of Contentscaused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Howmet may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates, at sites that it may acquire in the future, or at third-party sites used by Howmet, its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including remediation obligations, may prove to be more challenging and costly than the Company anticipates. Howmet’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, including increased remediation costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, the industrial activities conducted at Howmet’s facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees, customers or third parties that may be on site. We have experienced serious injuries in the past, notwithstanding the safety protocols, practices and precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies in the United States and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. From time to time, we have incurred fines for violations of various health and safety standards. In addition to industrial activities, the global COVID-19 pandemic will continue to significantly impact the health of our employees and increase the cost of health and safety measures within our operations. Significant community transmission in the vicinity of our operations is likely to impact the workforce availability due to quarantine and isolation practices. Social distancing, mask use, testing and other measures increase costs of operation. While we maintain insurance and have in place policies to minimize risks associated with industrial activities and COVID-19, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities relating to any injury, death or other workers compensation claims. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity and/or significant reputational harm.Howmet may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.Increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems, additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards in the United States. New or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect Howmet and its customers and suppliers, including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company or its customers or suppliers. Also, Howmet relies on natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities. Any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the Company and its customers and suppliers, which could also have a negative impact on Howmet’s profitability.Physical risk associated with climate change may result in an increase of the exposure and impact of events with damage due to flooding, extreme winds and extreme precipitation for Howmet locations, suppliers or customers. Prolonged periods of drought may result in wildfires, which may have an adverse effect on production capacity of Howmet sites, suppliers and customers. While we maintain insurance coverage, these types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources A decline in Howmet’s financial performance or outlook or a deterioration in its credit profile could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital markets, its liquidity and its borrowing costs.Howmet has significant capital requirements and depends, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic actions. A decline in the Company’s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors could affect the Company’s access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that Howmet will have access to the global capital market on terms the Company finds acceptable. Limitations on Howmet’s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in the Company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Howmet’s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.A downgrade of Howmet’s credit ratings could limit its ability to obtain future financing, increase borrowing costs and costs relating to credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of Howmet securities, trigger collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.Howmet’s credit ratings are important to the Company’s cost of capital. The major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations, execution and timeliness of financial reporting. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings Howmet receives impact our borrowing costs 20Table of Contentsas well as the terms upon which we will have access to capital. Failure to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position, and could also restrict our access to capital markets. For information on our credit ratings, see ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).There can be no assurance that one or more of the credit rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to Howmet’s ratings in the future. Increased debt levels, macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Company’s debt protection metrics, a contraction in the Company’s liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade of Howmet’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could result in adverse consequences, including: (i) adversely impact the market price of Howmet securities; (ii) adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by S&P or Moody’s would subject Howmet to higher costs under the Credit Agreement); (iii) limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; (iv) result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs; (v) increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities; or (vi) result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Howmet.Limitations on Howmet’s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in Howmet’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Howmet’s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.Howmet’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.Howmet requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Howmet’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Howmet’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Company’s position in relation to its competitors.An adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect Howmet’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.Howmet’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Howmet records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. Howmet calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"").These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Howmet to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Howmet is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity. For a discussion regarding how Howmet’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Howmet would contribute to the pension plans.Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Howmet who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (""HATFA"") extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (""BBA 2015"") extended the relief period provided by HATFA. Howmet believes that the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Company’s U.S. pension plans’ funded status over the next several years due to recent and potential future declines in discount rates. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Company’s cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Company’s liabilities related to such plans, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.21Table of ContentsHowmet is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, economic factors, and currency controls in the countries in which it operates.Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which Howmet operates, and volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect Howmet’s revenue, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, including the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan (renminbi), and Japanese yen, may affect Howmet’s profitability.In addition, a portion of Howmet’s indebtedness, including borrowings, if any, under the Company’s Five-Year Credit Facility, bears interest at rates equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Howmet’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Accordingly, the Company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. Further, LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include changes in the cost of Howmet’s variable rate indebtedness.Howmet also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the Company’s ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by Howmet’s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. While Howmet currently has no need, and does not intend, to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, should the Company need to do so to fund its operations, it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs. Howmet currently has operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including China, and, if the Company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on Howmet’s operating results and financial condition.Dividends and share repurchases fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors, depend on a number of factors, and are subject to limits under the Company’s Credit Agreement. Share repurchases and the declaration of dividends fall within the discretion of Howmet’s Board of Directors, and the Board’s decision regarding such matters depends on many factors, including Howmet’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Company’s debt obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant. In addition, under the Company’s amendment to the Credit Agreement, during the period from June 30, 2020 through December 31, 2021 (unless the Company ends this period earlier in accordance with the amendment or otherwise), common stock dividends and share repurchases are permitted only if no borrowings are outstanding under the Credit Agreement and are limited to an aggregate amount of $100 million through June 30, 2021, with such limit increasing to an aggregate amount of $250 million after June 30, 2021 if the Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio is no greater than 3.75 to 1.00. The Company suspended dividends in April 2020 to preserve cash and provide flexibility in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since June 30, 2020, the Company has repurchased approximately $73 million of its common stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will declare dividends or repurchase stock in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.General RisksFailure to attract and retain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce, or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect Howmet’s operations and competitiveness.Howmet’s global operations require highly skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience. Shortages in certain skills, in areas such as engineering, manufacturing and technology and other labor market inadequacies have created more competition for talent among us and other companies both within and outside of our industry. If the Company fails to attract, develop and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business, our operations could be adversely impacted.In addition, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the Company’s growth and business strategy. The loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm Howmet’s business, and any unplanned turnover, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions, could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base, result in loss of technical or other expertise, delay or impede the execution of the Company’s business plans and erode Howmet’s competitiveness.Howmet may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliances.Howmet has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio. There is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company, unanticipated costs and 22Table of Contentsliabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. The Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. Additionally, adverse factors may prevent Howmet from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines.With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, Howmet may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from customers, suppliers, unions, local or national governments, or other stakeholders. In addition, Howmet may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities or businesses, including, but not limited to, if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Howmet’s business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures.In addition, Howmet has participated in, and may continue to participate in, strategic alliances, joint ventures and other similar arrangements from time to time. Strategic alliances and joint ventures inherently involve special risks. Even if Howmet holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may have opposing economic or business interests, exercise veto rights to block Howmet actions, take action contrary to Howmet’s policies or objectives, or, as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable to fulfill their obligations.There can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures, closures, strategic alliances, joint ventures or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to Howmet, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in costs, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risks, or other factors.Anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Howmet, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of Howmet’s shareholders.Howmet’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Howmet’s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Howmet is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Howmet. Additionally, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes Howmet’s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other anti-takeover measures without stockholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Howmet’s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Howmet’s shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Howmet common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.Arconic Corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction.In connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Arconic Corporation and also entered into various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, an agreement related to the Davenport plant, an employee matters agreement, intellectual property license agreements, metal supply agreements and real estate and office leases. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the Company prior to the separation was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between us and Arconic Corporation following the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. We will rely on Arconic Corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Arconic Corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.In connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify Arconic Corporation for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to Arconic Corporation, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Arconic Corporation indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Arconic Corporation is allocated responsibility, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with Arconic Corporation, Arconic Corporation has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Arconic Corporation for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Arconic Corporation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Arconic Corporation has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in 23Table of Contentsfurtherance of the Company’s operations. Further, the indemnity from Arconic Corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Arconic Corporation any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction could result in substantial tax liability.It was a condition to the Distribution of Arconic that we receive an opinion of our outside counsel, satisfactory to our Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This condition was satisfied prior to the Distribution of Arconic. However, the opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings by us and Arconic Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct by us and Arconic Corporation. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Arconic Corporation breach any of our representations or covenants contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding our receipt of the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that the Distribution of Arconic and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that: (i) the IRS will not assert that the Distribution of Arconic and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii) a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, we, our stockholders and Arconic Corporation, could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.If the Distribution of Arconic fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the Arconic Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who received such Arconic Corporation shares in the Distribution of Arconic would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.Under current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution of Arconic, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution of Arconic may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us as a result of certain post-distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of ours or Arconic Corporation. Under the tax matters agreement entered into between us and Arconic Corporation in connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation may be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Arconic Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Arconic Corporation, or (iii) any of Arconic Corporation’s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Arconic Corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Arconic Corporation any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from transactions (including the internal reorganization) in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction could result in substantial tax liability.It was a condition to the Distribution of Alcoa that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction and the Distribution of Alcoa received by Howmet remain valid and be satisfactory to Howmet’s Board of Directors and (ii) Howmet receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the Distribution of Alcoa. However, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and 24Table of Contentsundertakings of Howmet and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Howmet and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Howmet or Alcoa Corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding Howmet’s receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution of Alcoa and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Howmet of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that (i) the IRS will not assert that the Distribution of Alcoa and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii) a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Howmet, Alcoa Corporation and Howmet shareholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.If the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Howmet would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Howmet shareholders who received Alcoa Corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.Under current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution of Alcoa may nevertheless be rendered taxable to Howmet and its shareholders as a result of certain post-Distribution of Alcoa transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of Howmet or Alcoa Corporation. The possibility of rendering the Distribution of Alcoa taxable as a result of such transactions may limit Howmet’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of Howmet’s business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that Howmet entered into with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation may be required to indemnify Howmet against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa Corporation or (iii) any of Alcoa Corporation’s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Howmet against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Howmet ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Howmet is held liable, Howmet may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, Howmet and Howmet’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction, including tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect Howmet’s business, results of operations and financial condition.",>Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.25Table of Contents,">Item 2.

Separation Transaction on November 1, 2016, the Company was known as Alcoa Inc. We have included the matters discussed below in which the Company remains party to proceedings relating to Alcoa Corporation. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction, provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Alcoa Corporation for claims subject to indemnification. The Company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it.St. Croix ProceedingsRed Dust Docket Cases, (St. Croix) f/k/a Abednego, Laurie L.A., et al. v. St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C., et al. On January 14, 2010, Alcoa Inc. was served with a multi-plaintiff action complaint involving several thousand individual persons claiming to be residents of St. Croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from Hurricane Georges or winds blowing material from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (“SCA”) facility on the island of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) since the time of the hurricane. This complaint, Abednego, et al. v. Alcoa, et al., was filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Alcoa Inc. and SCA to remove the case to federal court, the case has been lodged in the Superior Court. The complaint names as defendants the same entities that were sued in a February 1999 action arising out of the impact of Hurricane Georges on the island and added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property.On March 1, 2012, Alcoa Inc. was served with a separate multi-plaintiff action complaint involving approximately 200 individual persons alleging claims essentially identical to those set forth in the Abednego v. Alcoa complaint. This complaint, Abraham, et al. v. Alcoa, et al., was filed on behalf of plaintiffs previously dismissed in the federal court proceeding involving the original litigation over Hurricane Georges impacts. The matter was originally filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division, on March 30, 2011.Alcoa Inc. and other defendants in the Abraham and Abednego cases filed or renewed motions to dismiss each case in March 2012 and August 2012 following service of the Abraham complaint on Alcoa Inc. and remand of the Abednego complaint to 26Table of ContentsSuperior Court, respectively. By order dated August 10, 2015, the Superior Court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaints without prejudice to re-file the complaints individually, rather than as a multi-plaintiff filing. The order also preserves the defendants’ grounds for dismissal if new, individual complaints are filed. On July 7, 2017, the Court issued an order and associated memoranda on plaintiff’s multiple motions for extension of time to file the individual complaints. Following the court’s July 7, 2017 order, a total of 429 complaints were filed and accepted by the court by the deadline of July 30, 2017 (and consolidated into the Red Dust Claims docket (Master Case No.: SX-15-CV-620)). These complaints include claims of about 1,260 individual plaintiffs.On November 5, 2018, notice of an order of reassignment was entered, transferring the claims to the newly created Complex Litigation Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. On January 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking for a determination that expert testimony will not be required on the issue of causation, which defendants opposed.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts)OverviewOur BusinessHowmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Howmet’s innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other end markets. Howmet is a global company operating in 20 countries. Based upon the country where the point of shipment occurred, the United States and Europe generated 68% and 21%, respectively, of Howmet’s sales in 2020. In addition, Howmet has operating activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States and Europe, including Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in countries with such operating activities.Management Review of 2020 and Outlook for the FutureIn 2020, Sales decreased 26% over 2019 primarily as a result of lower volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets driven by the impacts of COVID-19 and 737 MAX and 787 production declines along with a decrease in sales of  $116 due to the divestiture of the forgings business in the United Kingdom in December 2019, all partially offset by 14% and 28% sales growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, respectively, as well as favorable product pricing.In the segments, Segment operating profit decreased 36% from 2019 due to lower volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets driven by the impacts of COVID-19 and 737 MAX  and 787 production declines and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by favorable product pricing, net cost savings and 14% and 28% sales growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, respectively.Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has continued its intensified focus on capital efficiency. This focus and the related results enabled Howmet to end 2020 with a solid financial position.The following financial information reflects certain key highlights of Howmet’s 2020 results:•Sales of $5,259 down 26% from 2019, with significant reductions in sales in commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX and 787 production declines; •Net income from continuing operations of $211, or $0.48 per diluted share;•Income from continuing operations before income taxes of $171, a decrease of $39, or 19%, from 2019;•Total segment operating profit of $890, a decrease of $500, or 36%, from 2019(1);•Cash provided from operations of $9; cash used for financing activities of $369; and cash provided from investing activities of $271;•Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,610; and•Total debt of $5,075, primarily due to a decrease of $865 from 2019, reflecting repayments of $2,040 along with $20 of other debt, partially offset by issuance of debt during the second quarter of 2020 of $1,200 notes due 2025.(1) See below in Results of Operations for the reconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.The Company rapidly executed on the separation plan that was announced during February 2019 with completion of the separation on April 1, 2020. The Company separated into two independent, publicly-traded companies, Howmet Aerospace Inc. and Arconic Corporation (the “Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction”). Howmet Aerospace is comprised of the Engineered Products and Forgings businesses (engine products, fastening systems, engineered structures, and forged wheels) and is listed under the stock ticker of “HWM.” Arconic Corporation is comprised of the former Global Rolled Products segment (global rolled products, aluminum extrusions, and building and construction systems) and is under the new company name Arconic Corporation, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ARNC.”  Results of OperationsEarnings SummarySales. Sales for 2020 were $5,259 compared with $7,098 in 2019, a decrease of $1,839, or 26%. The decrease was primarily a result of lower volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets driven by the impacts of 31Table of ContentsCOVID-19 and 737 MAX and 787 production declines along with a decrease in sales of $116 due to the divestiture of the forgings business in the U.K. in December 2019, all partially offset by growth in the defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets and favorable product pricing.Sales for 2019 were $7,098 compared with $6,778 in 2018, an increase of $320, or 5%. The increase was primarily due to volume growth in aerospace, commercial transportation, and industrial end markets; and favorable pricing when fulfilling volume above contractual share and renewing contracts; partially offset by lower sales from the divestitures of forgings businesses in the United Kingdom (divested in December 2019) and Hungary (divested in December 2018); and unfavorable foreign currency movements.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). COGS as a percentage of Sales was 73.7% in 2020 compared with 73.5% in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower volumes, partially offset by net cost savings, favorable product pricing, intentional product exits, and the impairment of energy business assets of $10 in the second quarter of 2019. In 2019, the Company sustained a fire at a fasteners plant in France. Additionally, in mid-February 2020, a fire occurred at the Company's forged wheels plant located in Barberton, Ohio. The Company submitted insurance claims related to these plant fires and received partial settlements of $39 in 2020 compared to $25 in 2019, which were in excess of the insurance deductible. In 2020, the Company recorded charges of $41 related to plant fires compared to $26 in 2019. The downtime reduced production levels and affected productivity at the plants.COGS as a percentage of Sales was 73.5% in 2019 compared with 75.4% in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower raw material costs; net costs savings; favorable product pricing; and costs incurred in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 related to settlements of certain customer claims, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix and the impairment of energy business assets of $10. Additionally, in 2019, the Company sustained a fire at a fasteners plant in France and recorded charges of $26 for higher operating costs, equipment and inventory damage, and repairs and cleanup costs. The Company submitted an insurance claim and received partial settlement of $25, which was in excess of its $10 insurance deductible. The insurance claim included $8 of margin not recognized from lost revenue due to the fire.Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses (SG&A). SG&A expenses were $277, or 5.3% of Sales, in 2020 compared with $400, or 5.6% of Sales, in 2019. The decrease in SG&A of $123, or 31%, was primarily due to overhead cost reductions and lower net legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $20, partially offset by higher costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction through June 30, 2020 of $2.SG&A expenses were $400, or 5.6% of Sales, in 2019 compared with $371, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2018. The increase in SG&A of $29, or 8%, was primarily due to costs associated with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction of $5 and higher annual incentive compensation accruals and executive compensation costs, partially offset by lower costs driven by overhead cost reductions and lower net legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $10, primarily due to insurance reimbursements.Research and Development Expenses (R&D). R&D expenses were $17 in 2020 compared with $28 in 2019. The decrease of $11, or 39%, was primarily due to the continued consolidation of the Company's primary R&D facility in conjunction with ongoing cost reduction efforts.R&D expenses were $28 in 2019 compared with $41 in 2018. The decrease of $13, or 32%, was primarily due to the consolidation of the Company's primary R&D facility in conjunction with ongoing cost reduction efforts.Provision for Depreciation and Amortization (D&A). The provision for D&A was $279 in 2020 compared with $295 in 2019. The decrease of $16, or 5%, was primarily driven by asset impairments of the Disks long-lived assets group during the second quarter of 2019 (see Notes O and P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K) and the impact of divestitures as well as lower corporate software amortization and research center depreciation, which were partially offset by increased Forged Wheels D&A due to the capacity expansion in Hungary, capacity expansions at two U.S. facilities and an additional $6 D&A related to the Barberton fire.The provision for D&A was $295 in 2019 compared with $314 in 2018. The decrease of $19, or 6% was primarily due to the impact of divestitures, as well as asset impairments of the Disks long-lived asset group during the second quarter of 2019 (see Note O and P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K).32Table of ContentsRestructuring and Other Charges. Restructuring and other charges were $182 in 2020 compared with $582 in 2019 and $163 in 2018.Restructuring and other charges in 2020 consisted primarily of a $113 charge for layoff costs, a $74 charge for U.K. and U.S. pension plans' settlement accounting; a $5 post-closing adjustment related to the sale of the Company’s U.K. forgings business; a $5 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell an aerospace components business in the U.K that did not occur and the business was returned to held for use; $5 charge related to the impairment of a cost method investment, which were partially offset by a benefit of $21 related to the reversal of a number of prior period programs; Restructuring and other charges in 2019 consisted primarily of a $428 charge for impairment of the Disks long-lived asset group; a $69 charge for layoff costs; a $46 charge for impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell the U.K. forgings business; a $14 charge for impairment of properties, plants, and equipment related to the Company’s primary research and development facility; a $13 loss on sale of assets primarily related to a small additive business; a $12 charge for other exit costs from lease terminations primarily related to the exit of the corporate aircraft; a $9 settlement accounting charge for U.S. pension plans; a $5 charge for impairment of a cost method investment; and a $7 charge for other exit costs; which were partially offset by a benefit of $16 related to the elimination of the life insurance benefit for the U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries.Restructuring and other charges in 2018 consisted primarily of a $96 charge for pension plan settlement accounting; a $23 charge for pension curtailment; a $43 loss on sale of a Hungary forgings business; a $18 charge for layoff costs; a $12 charge for contract termination costs and asset impairments associated with the shutdown of a facility in Acuna, Mexico; which were offset partially by a $28 postretirement curtailment benefit.See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Interest Expense. Interest expense was $381 in 2020 compared with $338 in 2019. The increase of $43, or 13%, was primarily due to premiums paid on the early redemption of debt of $59 which was offset by lower debt outstanding in 2020 driven by the early redemption of $1,000, $889 and $151 of the principal amount of the 6.150% Notes, 5.400% Notes due in 2021 and 5.870% Notes due in 2022, respectively, in April and May 2020, which was offset by the issuance on April 24, 2020 of the 6.875% Notes due 2025 in the aggregate principal amount of $1,200.Interest expense was $338 in 2019 compared with $377 in 2018. The decrease of $39, or 10%, was primarily due to lower debt outstanding, driven by the repayment of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 1.63% Convertible Notes of approximately $403 on October 15, 2019, as well as costs incurred of $19 in 2018 related to the premium paid on the early redemption of the Company’s then outstanding 5.72% Senior Notes due in 2019 that did not recur in 2019.On January 15, 2021, the Company completed the early redemption of all of the remaining $361 aggregate principal amount of the 5.400% Notes due in April 2021 (the ""5.400% Notes"") as well as $5 in accrued interest.  The redemption of these 5.400% Notes will save approximately $5 in Interest expense, net in the first quarter of 2021 and $19 annually.Other Expense (Income), Net. Other expense (income), net was $74 in 2020 compared with $31 in 2019. The increase in expense of $43 was primarily driven by the write-off of an indemnification receivable related to a Spanish tax reserve reflecting Alcoa Corporation's 49% share and Arconic Corporation's 33.66% share of a Spanish tax reserve of $53 and lower interest income of $19, which were partially offset by lower deferred compensation expense of $14 and favorable foreign currency movements of $16.Other expense (income), net was $31 in 2019 compared with Other expense (income), net of $(30) in 2018. The increase in Other expense, net of $61 was primarily due to an increase in deferred compensation expense of $32 and the benefit recognized in 2018 from establishing a tax indemnification receivable reflecting Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of a Spanish tax reserve of $29.Income Taxes. Howmet’s effective tax rate was 23.4% (benefit on pre-tax income) in 2020 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $64 benefit related to the release of an income tax reserve following a favorable Spanish tax case decision, a $30 benefit related to the recognition of a previously uncertain U.S. tax position, and a $30 benefit for a U.S. tax law change related to the issuance of final regulations that provide for an exclusion of certain high-taxed foreign earnings from the calculation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI""), partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings, $8 of charges related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances as a result of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the tax impact of $49 of nondeductible loss related to the reversal of indemnification receivables associated with the favorable Spanish tax case decision, and the tax impact of other nondeductible expenses.Howmet’s effective tax rate was 40.0% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2019 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of foreign income taxed in higher rate 33Table of Contentsjurisdictions and subject to U.S. taxes including GILTI, foreign losses with no tax benefit, and other nondeductible expenses, partially offset by a $24 benefit associated with the deduction of foreign taxes that were previously claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit, and a $12 benefit for a foreign tax rate change.Howmet’s effective tax rate was 27.8% (provision on pre-tax income) in 2018 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $60 charge to establish a tax reserve in Spain, a $59 net charge resulting from the Company's finalized analysis of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""2017 Act""), and foreign income taxed in higher rate jurisdictions and subject to U.S. taxes including GILTI, partially offset by a $74 benefit related to the reversal of a foreign recapture obligation, a $38 benefit to reverse a foreign tax reserve that was effectively settled, and a $10 benefit for the release of U.S. valuation allowances.Howmet anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 26.5% and 28.5%. However, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stock-based payment awards, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate.Net Income from Continuing Operations. Net income from continuing operations was $211, or $0.48 per diluted share, for 2020 compared to $126, or $0.27 per diluted share, in 2019. The increase in results of $85, or 67%, was primarily due to the non-recurring 2019 impact of the $428 charge for impairment of the Disks long-lived asset group included in Restructuring and other charges, a decrease of $123 due to lower SG&A costs, favorable product pricing, and a net $10 related to the settlement of the Spanish corporate income tax audit, partially offset by a decrease in volumes in the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, the impact of COVID-19, and an increase in premiums paid on the early redemption of debt of $59.Net income from continuing operations was $126, or $0.27 per diluted share, for 2019 compared to $309, or $0.63 per diluted share, for 2018. The decrease in results of $183, or 59%, was primarily due to higher Restructuring charges primarily due to the non-recurring 2019 impact of the $428 charge for impairment of the Disks long-lived asset group, higher SG&A costs related primarily to annual incentive compensation accruals and executive compensation costs, higher Other expense, net due to an increase in deferred compensation expense, and the benefit recognized in 2018 from establishing a tax indemnification receivable reflecting Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of a Spanish tax reserve of $29 that did not recur in 2019, partially offset by volume growth, favorable product pricing, net cost savings, lower D&A due to the impact of divestitures as well as asset impairments related to the Disks long-lived asset group, lower Interest expense due to lower debt outstanding and costs incurred of $19 in 2018 related to the premium paid on the early redemption of debt that did not recur in 2019, and lower Income taxes primarily as a result of a benefit related to a U.S. tax election which caused the deemed liquidation of a foreign subsidiary’s assets into its U.S. tax parent.Net Income. Net income was $261 for 2020 composed of $211 of income from continuing operations and $50 from discontinued operations, or $0.48 and $0.11 per diluted share, respectively. Net income was $470 for 2019 composed of $126 of income from continuing operations and $344 from discontinued operations, or $0.27 and $0.76 per diluted share, respectively.Net income was $642 for 2018 composed of $309 of income from continuing operations and $333 from discontinued operations, or $0.63 and $0.67 per diluted share, respectively.See details of discontinued operations in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Segment InformationThe Company’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures and Forged Wheels. Segment performance under Howmet’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Howmet’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and Other charges and Impairment of Goodwill. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between segment totals and consolidated Howmet are in Corporate.In the second quarter of 2020, the Company realigned its operations consistent with how the Co-Chief Executive Officers assess operating performance and allocating capital in conjunction with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Prior period financial information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.The Company produces aerospace engine parts and components and aerospace fastening systems for Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. In late December 2019, Boeing announced a temporary suspension of production of the 737 MAX airplanes. This decline in production had a negative impact on sales and segment operating profit in the Engine Products, Fastening Systems and Engineered Structures segments for the full year ended December 31, 2020. While regulatory authorities in the United 34Table of ContentsStates and certain other jurisdictions lifted grounding orders beginning in late 2020, our sales could continue to be negatively affected from the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding.Income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled $171 in 2020, $210 in 2019, and $428 in 2018. Segment operating profit for all reportable segments totaled $890 in 2020, $1,390 in 2019, and $1,105 in 2018. The following information provides Sales and Segment operating profit for each reportable segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020.

Management continued to focus on actions to improve Howmet’s cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures.Cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Howmet's operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of Howmet were $1,610, of which $253 was held by Howmet's non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries were to be repatriated to the U.S., the company does not expect there to be additional material income tax consequences.The cash flows related to Arconic Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for all periods prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction. During 2020 the Company identified a misclassification in the presentation of changes in accounts payable and capital expenditures in its previously issued Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, and has revised its Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for 2019. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional detail.Operating ActivitiesCash provided from operations in 2020 was $9 compared with $461 in 2019 and $217 in 2018. The decrease in cash used for operations of $452, or 98%, between 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to lower operating results of $874, partially offset by lower working capital of $355 and lower noncurrent assets of $46, noncurrent liabilities of $10 and pension contributions of $11. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes in receivables of $739, inventories of $77, and taxes, including income taxes of $100, offset by accounts payable of $380, accrued expenses of $175 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.The increase of $244, or 112%, between 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to higher operating results of $279 and lower pension contributions of $30 and noncurrent assets of $13, partially offset by higher working capital of $57 and noncurrent liabilities of $21. The components of the change in working capital included unfavorable changes in accounts payable of $340 and taxes, including income taxes of $106, partially offset by favorable changes in receivables of $165 accrued expenses of $148, inventories of $71 and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $5. Financing ActivitiesCash used for financing activities was $369 in 2020 compared with $1,568 in 2019 and $649 in 2018.The use of cash in 2020 was primarily related to the repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 6.15% Notes due 2020 of approximately $2,040 (see Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), cash distributed to Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction of $500, repurchase of common stock of $73 (see Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), debt issuance costs of $61, premiums paid on the redemption of debt of $59, and dividends paid to shareholders of $11. These items were partially offset by long-term debt issuance of $2,400 (of which $1,200 went with Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction) and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $33.The use of cash in 2019 was primarily related to the repurchase of $1,150 of common stock (see Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data); repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 1.63% Convertible Notes of approximately $403 (see Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data)); and dividends paid to shareholders of $57. These items were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $56.The use of cash in 2018 was principally the result of $1,103 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the then remaining outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019 (see Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and 38Table of ContentsSupplementary Data of this Form 10-K)) and $119 in dividends to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $600 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities.The Company maintains a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. On June 26, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement to modify certain terms which provided relief from its existing financial covenant through December 31, 2021 and reduced total commitment available from $1,500 to $1,000. See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. In addition to the Credit Agreement, the Company has other credit facilities from time to time.The Company may in the future repurchase additional portions of its debt or equity securities from time to time, in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws.The Company’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to the Company by the major credit rating agencies.The Company's credit ratings from the three major credit rating agencies are as follows:  Long-Term DebtShort-Term DebtOutlookDate of Last UpdateStandard and Poor’sBB+BNegativeSeptember 9, 2020Moody’sBa3Speculative Grade Liquidity-2NegativeApril 23, 2020FitchBBB-BStableApril 22, 2020Investing ActivitiesCash provided from investing activities was $271 in 2020 compared with $528 in 2019 and $565 in 2018.The source of cash in 2020 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $422 and proceeds from the sale a rolling mill business in Itapissuma, Brazil for $50 and a hard alloy extrusions plant in South Korea for $62 which were related to Arconic Corporation (see Notes C and U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data)), partially offset by capital expenditures of $267.The source of cash in 2019 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $995, proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses of $103 primarily from the sale of a forgings business in the U.K. for $64 and the sale of inventories and properties, plants, and equipment related to a small energy business for $13 as well as contingent consideration of $20 related to the sale of the Texarkana, Texas rolling mill (which was part of Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction) (see Notes C and U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data)), and the sale of fixed income securities of $73, partially offset by capital expenditures of $641, including expansion of a wheels plant in Hungary, expansion of aerospace airfoils capacity in the United States, and transition of the Tennessee plant to industrial production (which was part of Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction).The source of cash in 2018 was primarily cash receipts from sold receivables of $1,016 and proceeds from the sale of the Texarkana, Texas rolling mill and cast house of $302 which was related to Arconic Corporation, partially offset by capital expenditures of $768, including the horizontal heat treat furnace at the Davenport, Iowa plant (which was part of Arconic Corporation at the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction) and an expansion of a wheels plant in Székesfehérvár, Hungary.39Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual Obligations Howmet is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Howmet also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2020, a summary of Howmet’s outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information):Total20212022-20232024-2025ThereafterOperating activities:Raw material purchase obligations$205 $159 $38 $8 $— Other purchase obligations54 51 3 — — Operating leases163 44 59 28 32 Interest related to total debt1,941 286 519 400 736 Estimated minimum required pension funding514 140 229 145 — Other postretirement benefit payments146 17 32 30 67 Layoff and other restructuring payments54 54 — — — Uncertain tax positions2 — — — 2 Financing activities:Total debt5,102 376 476 2,450 1,800 Investing activities:Capital projects169 123 46 — — Totals$8,350 $1,250 $1,402 $3,061 $2,637 Obligations for Operating ActivitiesRaw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, cobalt, nickel, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to five years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. The Company generally passes through metal costs in customer contracts with limited exceptions. In connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the Company entered into several agreements with Arconic Corporation that govern the relationship between the Company and Arconic Corporation following the separation, including Raw Material Supply Agreements. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates, among others. It is Howmet’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Howmet contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. The estimates reported in the preceding table include amounts sufficient to meet the minimum required. Howmet has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2024 and 2029, respectively.Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs, special layoff benefit payments, and lease termination costs.Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2020. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “Thereafter” column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.40Table of ContentsObligations for Financing ActivitiesHowmet has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, the Company paid $11 in dividends to shareholders during 2020. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Howmet’s Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2020, there were 432,906,377 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding Class A preferred stock. In 2020, the preferred stock dividend was $3.75 per share. Dividend of $0.02 per share on the Company's common stock was paid in the first quarter of 2020. As the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, the Company is taking a series of actions to address the financial impact, including the suspension of dividends on common stock in April 2020. See Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors). Obligations for Investing ActivitiesCapital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2020. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 4% of sales in 2021.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2021 and 2040 was $44 at December 31, 2020.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $12 and $9 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. For a long-term supply agreement, the Company is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,398 and $1,353 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. This guarantee expires in 2047. For this guarantee, subject to its provisions, the Company is secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation. The Company currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote. In December 2019, Arconic Inc. entered into a one-year insurance policy with a limit of $80 relating to the long-term energy supply agreement. The premium is expected to be paid by Alcoa Corporation. In December 2020, a surety bond with a limit of $80 relating to the long-term energy supply agreement was obtained by Alcoa Corporation to protect Howmet's obligation. This surety bond will be renewed on an annual basis.Howmet has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2021, was $105 at December 31, 2020.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreements between the Company and Arconic Corporation and between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is required to retain letters of credit of $53 that had previously been provided related to the Company, Arconic Corporation, and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of April 1, 2020 and November 1, 2016. Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by the Company are being proportionally billed to and are being reimbursed by Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation. Also, the Company was required to provide letters of credit for certain Arconic Corporation environmental obligations and, as a result, the Company has $29 of outstanding letters of credit relating to liabilities (which are included in the $105 in the above paragraph). $13 of these outstanding letters of credit are pending cancellation and will be deemed cancelled once returned by the beneficiary. Arconic Corporation has issued surety bonds to cover these environmental obligations. Arconic Corporation is being billed for these letter of credit fees paid by the Company and will reimburse the Company for any payments made under these letters of credit.Howmet has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these surety bonds, which expire at various dates, primarily in 2021, was $43 at December 31, 2020.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreements between the Company and Arconic Corporation and between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company was required to provide surety bonds of $26 (which are included in the $43 in the above paragraph) that had previously been provided, related to the Company, Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of April 1, 2020 and November 1, 2016. Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation letters of credit and surety bond fees paid by the Company are being proportionally billed to and are being reimbursed by Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation.41Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations relating to the impact of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 is rapidly changing and of unknown duration and macroeconomic impact and as a result, these considerations remain highly uncertain. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Howmet had four reporting units (Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels) for 2020.In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.The Company determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Howmet’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (""WACC"") between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the first quarter of 2020, Howmet's market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of our peer group companies, and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures designed to contain the spread, sales globally to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries impacted by COVID-19 have been and are expected to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand. As a result of these macroeconomic factors, we performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our 42Table of Contentsreporting units is less than its carrying value. As a result of this assessment, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test in the first quarter for the Engineered Structures reporting unit and concluded that though the margin between the fair value of the reporting unit and carrying value had declined from approximately 60% to approximately 15%, it was not impaired.  Consistent with prior practice, a discounted cash flow model was used to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit. The significant assumptions and estimates utilized to determine fair value were developed utilizing current market and forecast information reflecting the disruption in demand that has had and is expected to have a negative impact on the Company’s global sales in the aerospace industry. During the second and third quarters of 2020, there were no indicators of impairment identified for the Engineered Structures reporting unit.During the 2020 annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all four of its reporting units. The estimated fair values for each of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 50% or greater; thus, there was no goodwill impairment. The annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 also indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units.Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Howmet uses a discounted cash flow (""DCF"") model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth, production costs, capital spending, and discount rate. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Howmet would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Properties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments.During the second quarter of 2019, the Company updated its five-year strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the Disks asset group within the Engine Products and Forgings segment at that time.  As such, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the Disks asset group long-lived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows of the Disks asset group. The carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the Disks asset group long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the long-lived assets, with fair value determined using a DCF model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence. The impairment charge of $428, of which $247 and $181 related to the Engine Products and Engineered Structures segments, respectively, which was recorded in the second quarter of 2019, impacted properties, plants, and equipment; intangible assets; and certain other noncurrent assets by $198, $197, and $33, respectively. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities for the U.S. is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary, while both the U.K. and Canada utilize models 43Table of Contentsdeveloped by the respective actuary. The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have a global average duration of 12 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 2.40%, 3.00%, and 4.00%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $90 and either a charge or credit of approximately $1 to earnings in the following year.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2020, 2019, and 2018, management used 6.00%, 5.60%, and 5.90%, respectively, as its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. For 2021, management anticipates that 6.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact earnings by approximately $4 for 2021.In 2020, a net loss of $46 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and by amortization of actuarial losses. After adjusting for the impact of Arconic Corporation's obligation, the net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation decreased less than 2% during 2020. In 2019, a net loss of $388 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2018, a net loss of $114 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance that permits a reclassification to Retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as well as the plan asset performance that was less than expected, which were partially offset by the increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses. Stock-Based Compensation. Howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.Compensation expense recorded in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $46 ($42 after-tax), $69 ($63 after-tax), and $40 ($31 after-tax), respectively. Income Taxes. The provision (benefit) for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision (benefit) for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) based on current year pre-tax income plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Howmet’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Howmet’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. 44Table of ContentsExisting valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.The 2017 Act created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (""GILTI""), must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. In 2018, Howmet made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Management’s Reports to Howmet ShareholdersManagement’s Report on Financial Statements and PracticesThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Howmet Aerospace Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO""). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Based on the assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. /s/ John C.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting PrincipleAs discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.47Table of ContentsCritical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Goodwill Impairment Assessments – Engineered Structures Reporting UnitAs described in Notes A and P to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $4,102 million as of December 31, 2020, and the amount of the goodwill associated with the Engineered Structures reporting unit was $304 million. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. During the first quarter of 2020, management performed a quantitative impairment test for the Engineered Structures reporting unit and concluded that it was not impaired. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value using this technique requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasting operating cash flows, including sales growth, production costs, capital spending, and discount rate.  The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments of the Engineered Structures reporting unit is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurements of the reporting unit. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s cash flow projections and significant assumptions related to sales growth, production costs, and discount rate for the first quarter assessment, and sales growth and production costs for the annual impairment assessment. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.  Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s Engineered Structures reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and performing sensitivity analyses over the assumptions; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to sales growth, production costs, and discount rate for the first quarter assessment and sales growth and production costs for the annual impairment assessment. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth and production costs involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable by considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with relevant industry data, and (iii) considering whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discounted cash flow models and, for the first quarter assessment, the discount rate assumption./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaFebruary 16, 2021We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1950.48Table of ContentsHowmet Aerospace Inc. and subsidiariesStatement of Consolidated Operations(in millions, except per-share amounts) For the year ended December 31,202020192018Sales (D)$5,259 $7,098 $6,778 Cost of goods sold (exclusive of expenses below)3,878 5,214 5,114 Selling, general administrative, and other expenses277 400 371 Research and development expenses17 28 41 Provision for depreciation and amortization279 295 314 Restructuring and other charges (E)182 582 163 Operating income626 579 775 Interest expense (F)381 338 377 Other expense (income), net (G)74 31 (30)Income before income taxes171 210 428 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (I)(40)84 119 Income from continuing operations after income taxes$211 $126 $309 Income from discontinued operations after income taxes (C)50 344 333 Net income$261 $470 $642 Amounts Attributable to Howmet Aerospace Common Shareholders (K):Net income$259 $477 $651 Earnings per share -

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Howmet Aerospace Inc. (formerly known as Arconic Inc.) and subsidiaries (“Howmet” or the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") and require management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations relating to the impact of the global pandemic coronavirus (“COVID-19”). The impact of COVID-19 is rapidly changing and of unknown duration and macroeconomic impact and as a result, these considerations remain highly uncertain. We have made our best estimates using all relevant information available at the time, but it is possible that our estimates will differ from our actual results and affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and potentially require adverse adjustments to the recoverability of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and other judgments and estimations and assumptions. These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. The separation of Arconic Inc. into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Howmet Aerospace Inc. and Arconic Corporation, (the “Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction”) occurred on April 1, 2020. The Engineered Products and Forgings (""EP&F"") segment remained in the existing company which was renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. The Global Rolled Products (""GRP"") segment was the Spin Co. and was named Arconic Corporation. In the second quarter of 2020, in conjunction with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the Company realigned its operations by separating the former EP&F segment into four new segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures and Forged Wheels. See Note D for further details.The financial results of Arconic Corporation for all periods prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction have been retrospectively reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. In addition, the related assets and liabilities associated with Arconic Corporation in the December 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. The cash flows, comprehensive income, and equity related to Arconic Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income, and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity, respectively, for all periods prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction. See Note C for additional information related to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and discontinued operations.The Company derived approximately 69%, 71% and 70% of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace end-market for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As a result of COVID-19 and its impact on the aerospace industry to-date, the possibility exists that there could be a sustained impact to our operations and financial results. Since the start of the pandemic, certain original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers have reduced production or suspended manufacturing operations in North America and Europe on a temporary basis. While the pandemic has resulted in the temporary closure of a small number of the Company's manufacturing facilities, all of our manufacturing facilities are currently operating. Since the duration of the pandemic is uncertain, the Company is taking a series of actions to address the financial impact, including announcing certain headcount reductions and reducing certain cash outflows by suspending dividends on common stock and reducing the level of its capital expenditures to preserve cash and maintain liquidity. The Company identified a misclassification in the presentation of changes in accounts payable and capital expenditures in its previously issued Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows during 2020. Although management has determined that such misclassification did not materially misstate the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company has revised it resulting in a $55 increase to previously reported capital expenditures and decrease to cash provided from investing activities with a corresponding reduction (decrease) in accounts payable, trade and increase in cash provided by operations.A $16 deferred tax error was identified related to periods prior to 2018 during 2020. Although management has determined it was not material to any periods, the Company has revised its Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 to present the correction as a reduction to Retained Earnings as of December 31, 2017. The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 also reflects the revision for such tax item.Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Howmet Aerospace Inc. and companies in which Howmet Aerospace Inc. has a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which Howmet Aerospace Inc. cannot exercise significant influence that do not have readily 54Table of Contentsdeterminable fair values are accounted for at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.Management also evaluates whether a Howmet Aerospace Inc. entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether Howmet Aerospace Inc. is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. Howmet Aerospace Inc. does not have any variable interest entities requiring consolidation.Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.Inventory Valuation. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value with the cost of inventories  determined under a combination of the first-in, first-out (""FIFO""), last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") and average-cost methods. See Note N for further details.Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded principally on the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of structures and machinery and equipment by reporting segment (numbers in years):StructuresMachinery and equipment   Engine Products3016   Fastening Systems2817   Engineered Structures2818   Forged Wheels2918Gains or losses from the sale of asset groups are generally recorded in Restructuring and other charges while the sale of individual assets are recorded in Other expense (income), net (see policy below for assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations). Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Interest related to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs.Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (""DCF"") model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments. See Note O for further details.Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Howmet had four reporting units composed of the Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures and Forged Wheels segments.In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Howmet determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that 55Table of Contentsan impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Howmet's policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (""WACC"") between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the first quarter of 2020, Howmet's market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of our peer group companies, and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures designed to contain the spread, sales globally to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries impacted by COVID-19 have been and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand. As a result of these macroeconomic factors, we performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value. As a result of this assessment, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test in the first quarter for the Engineered Structures reporting unit and concluded that though the margin between the fair value of the reporting unit and carrying value had declined from approximately 60% to approximately 15%, it was not impaired. Consistent with prior practice, a discounted cash flow model was used to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit. The significant assumptions and estimates utilized to determine fair value were developed utilizing current market and forecast information reflecting the disruption in demand that has and is expected to negatively impact the Company’s sales globally in the aerospace industry. During the second and third quarters of 2020, there were no indicators of impairment identified for the Engineered Structures reporting unit.   During the 2020 annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all four of its reporting units. The estimated fair values for each of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 50%, thus, there was no goodwill impairment. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Howmet uses a DCF model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth, production costs, capital spending, and discount rate. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. The annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units. If actual results or external market factors decline significantly from management’s estimates, future goodwill impairment charges (or the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit) may be necessary and could be material. In the first quarter of 2020, management transferred its Savannah, Georgia business from the Engine Products reporting unit to the Engineered Structures reporting unit. As a result of the reorganization, these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2020. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no goodwill impairment. In the second quarter of 2019, the Company transferred its castings operations from Engineered Structures to Engine Products. As a result, these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2019. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no impairment.  In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the decline in the forecasted financial performance and related impairment of long-lived assets of the Disks asset group which composed business currently in the Engine Products and Engineered Structures segments (see Note O), the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for Engine Products. The estimated fair value of the Engine Products reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.In connection with the interim impairment evaluation of long-lived assets for the Disks asset group in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted from a decline in forecasted financial performance for the business in connection with its updated three-year strategic plan, the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for Engine Products. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.56Table of ContentsOther Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by reporting segment (numbers in years):SoftwareOther intangible assets   Engine Products733   Fastening Systems623   Engineered Structures410   Forged Wheels423Leases. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company leases land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment which have been classified as operating leases. Certain real estate leases include one or more options to renew; the exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. The Company includes renewal option periods in the lease term when it is determined that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Certain of Howmet's real estate lease agreements include rental payments that either have fixed contractual increases over time or adjust periodically for inflation. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include variable lease payments. The variable portion of payments is not included in the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and is recorded as lease cost in the period incurred. The Company also rents or subleases certain real estate to third parties, which is not material to the consolidated financial statements.Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities with an initial term greater than 12 months are recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company uses an incremental collateralized borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, as most of its leases do not provide an implicit rate. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease prepayments made and were reduced by lease incentives and accrued exit costs.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future sales, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Howmet has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Revenue Recognition. The Company's contracts with customers are comprised of acknowledged purchase orders incorporating the Company’s standard terms and conditions, or for larger customers, may also generally include terms under negotiated multi-year agreements. These contracts with customers typically consist of the manufacture of products which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied upon transfer of control of the product to the customer. The Company produces fastening systems; seamless rolled rings; investment castings, including airfoils; extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts; and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels. Transfer of control is assessed based on alternative use of the products we produce and our enforceable right to payment for performance to date under the contract terms. Transfer of control and revenue recognition generally occur upon shipment or delivery of the product, which is when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the 57Table of Contentsproduct, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (truck, train, or vessel). An invoice for payment is issued at time of shipment. Our segments set commercial terms on which Howmet sells products to its customers. These terms are influenced by industry custom, market conditions, product line (specialty versus commodity products), and other considerations.In certain circumstances, Howmet receives advanced payments from its customers for product to be delivered in future periods. These advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the product is delivered and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred revenue is included in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Advanced payments were $97 and $85 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Howmet’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Howmet’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, the Company made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI"") inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Stock-Based Compensation. Howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.Foreign Currency. The local currency is the functional currency for Howmet’s significant operations outside the United States (""U.S.""), except for certain operations in Canada, United Kingdom and France, where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. The determination of the functional currency for Howmet’s operations is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators.Acquisitions. Howmet’s business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Statement of Consolidated Operations from the date of the acquisition.58Table of ContentsDiscontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. For those businesses where management has committed to a plan to divest, each business is valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets of a business to be divested once they are classified as held for sale. Businesses to be divested are generally classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as either discontinued operations or held for sale.For businesses classified as discontinued operations, the balance sheet amounts and results of operations should be reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, respectively, for all periods presented. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows is not required to be reclassified for discontinued operations for any period. Segment information does not include the assets or operating results of businesses classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These businesses are expected to be disposed of within one year.For businesses classified as held for sale that do not qualify for discontinued operations treatment, the balance sheet and cash flow amounts should be reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale for all periods presented. The results of operations continue to be reported in continuing operations. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The segment information includes the assets and operating results of businesses classified as held for sale for all periods presented.B. Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting GuidanceRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") related to the impairment model for expected credit losses. The new impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (""CECL"") model) is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The Company recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments, trade receivables, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and other loan commitments and requires the measurement of expected credit losses on assets including those that have a low risk of loss. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that impacts disclosures for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These changes became effective for Howmet's annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020 which did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting and presentation of leases. These changes required lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet, initially measured at the present value of lease payments for all operating leases with a term greater than 12 months. These changes became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and have been applied using the modified retrospective approach as of the date of adoption, under which leases existing at, or entered into after, January 1, 2019 were required to be recognized and measured. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reflected in accordance with the Company’s historical accounting. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company also elected to separate lease components from non-lease components for all classes of assets.The adoption of this new lease standard resulted in the Company recording operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $320 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of the new lease standard had no impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations or Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. The Company entered into a sale leaseback arrangement in October 2018 for a cast house that is now part of Arconic Corporation, and due to continuing involvement, the gain on sale was deferred. In connection with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019, the arrangement no longer required that the gain be deferred. As such, the associated $73 deferred gain, net of tax was recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting change within Accumulated deficit in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity. In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance that made more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amended the presentation and disclosure requirements and changed how companies assess effectiveness. It is 59Table of Contentsintended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. These changes became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. For cash flow hedges, Howmet recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness by decreasing Accumulated other comprehensive loss and increasing Retained earnings on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity. The amendments to presentation and disclosure are required prospectively. Howmet has determined that under the new accounting guidance it is able to more broadly use cash flow hedge accounting for its variable priced inventory purchases and customer sales.In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows an optional reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. Stranded tax effects were created when deferred taxes, originally established in Other comprehensive income at 35%, were revalued to 21% as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. The Company elected to early adopt this provision in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reclassified $367 of beneficial stranded tax effects in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Retained earnings in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity.Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance that is intended to simplify various aspects related to the accounting for income taxes. These changes became effective for Howmet on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued amendments that provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference London Inter-bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements.C. Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and Discontinued OperationsOn April 1, 2020, the Company completed the previously announced separation of its business into two independent, publicly-traded companies. Following the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation held the Global Rolled Products businesses (global rolled products, aluminum extrusions, and building and construction systems) previously held by the Company. The Company retained the Engineered Products and Forgings businesses (engine products, fastening systems, engineered structures, and forged wheels).The Company's Board of Directors approved the completion of the separation on February 5, 2020, which was effected by the distribution (the ""Distribution"") by the Company of all of the outstanding common stock of Arconic Corporation on April 1, 2020 to the Company’s stockholders who held shares as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the ""Record Date""). In the Distribution, each Company stockholder of record as of the Record Date received one share of Arconic Corporation common stock for every four shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company did not issue fractional shares of Arconic Corporation common stock in the Distribution. Instead, each stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Arconic Corporation common stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares.In connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the Company entered into several agreements with Arconic Corporation that govern the relationship between the Company and Arconic Corporation following the Distribution, including the following: a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License and Trademark License Agreements, and Raw Material Supply Agreements.On February 7, 2020, Arconic Corporation completed an offering of $600 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior secured second-lien notes due 2028. On March 25, 2020, Arconic Corporation entered into a credit agreement which provided for a $600 aggregate principal amount seven-year senior secured first-lien loan B facility and a revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by certain of Arconic Corporation's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and secured on a first-priority basis by liens on substantially all assets of Arconic Corporation and subsidiary guarantors. Arconic Corporation used the proceeds to make payment to the Company to fund the transfer of certain assets to Arconic Corporation relating to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and for general corporate purposes. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $45 associated with these issuances for the first quarter of 2020 and year ended December 31, 2020.On February 1, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its rolling mill in Itapissuma, Brazil for $50 in cash which resulted in a loss of $59, of which $53 was recognized in discontinued operations in the second half of 2019 and $6 in the first quarter of 2020 and year ended December 31, 2020. On March 1, 2020, the Company sold its hard alloy extrusions plant in South Korea 60Table of Contentsfor $62 in cash, which resulted in a gain that was recognized in discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2020 and year ended December 31, 2020.On October 31, 2018, the Company sold its Texarkana, Texas rolling mill and cast house, which had a combined net book value of $63, to Ta Chen International, Inc. for $302 in cash, including the settlement of post-closing adjustments, plus additional contingent consideration of up to $50. The contingent consideration related to the achievement of various milestones within 36 months of the transaction closing date associated with operationalizing the rolling mill equipment. As part of the agreement, the Company produced aluminum slab at the facility for a period of 18 months through a lease back of the cast house building and equipment. The sale of the rolling mill and cast house had been accounted for separately. The gain on the sale of the rolling mill of $154, including the fair value of contingent consideration of $5, was recorded in 2018. In 2019, the Company received additional contingent consideration of $20 and recorded a gain. These amounts were recorded in discontinued operations in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Company had continuing involvement related to the lease back of the cast house. As a result, in 2018, the Company continued to treat the cast house building and equipment that it sold to Ta Chen as owned. In conjunction with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019 (see Note B), the Company's continuing involvement no longer required deferral of the recognition of the cast house sale. As such, the cash proceeds, properties, plant and equipment and deferred tax assets related to the cast house were reclassified to Retained earnings as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of $73 in 2018.Discontinued OperationsThe results of operations of Arconic Corporation are presented as discontinued operations in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as summarized below:     Year ended December 31,202020192018Sales$1,576 $7,094 $7,236 Cost of goods sold1,292 6,013 6,283 Selling, general administrative, research and development and other expenses106 346 295 Provision for depreciation and amortization 59 241 262 Restructuring and other charges (credits)(18)38 (154)Interest expense7 — 1 Other expense, net42 91 109 Income from discontinued operations88 365 440 Provision for income taxes38 21 107 Income from discontinued operations after income taxes $50 $344 $333 The following table presents purchases of properties, plant and equipment (capital expenditures), proceeds from the sale of businesses and provision for depreciation and amortization of discontinued operations related to Arconic Corporation:Year ended December 31,202020192018Capital expenditures$72 $210 $308 Proceeds from the sales of businesses$112 $20 $309 Provision for depreciation and amortization$59 $241 $262 On April 1, 2020, management evaluated the net assets of Arconic Corporation for potential impairment and determined that no impairment charge was required.The cash flows and equity related to Arconic Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows or Statement of Comprehensive Income for all periods presented prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction.61Table of ContentsThe carrying amount of the major classes of assets and liabilities related to Arconic Corporation classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the following:December 31, 2019Total Assets of Discontinued OperationsCash and cash equivalents$71 Receivables from customers385 Other receivables135 Inventories822 Prepaid expenses and other current assets29 Current assets of discontinued operations1,442 Properties, plants, and equipment, net2,834 Goodwill426 Intangibles, net60 Deferred income taxes383 Other noncurrent assets196 Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations3,899 Total assets of discontinued operations$5,341 Total Liabilities of Discontinued Operations:Accounts payable, trade$1,067 Accrued compensation and retirement costs147 Taxes, including income taxes22 Other current liabilities188 Current liabilities of discontinued operations1,424 Accrued pension benefits1,429 Accrued other postretirement benefits514 Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits315 Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations2,258 Total liabilities of discontinued operations$3,682 D. Segment and Geographic Area InformationHowmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Howmet’s innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other end markets. Segment performance under Howmet’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Howmet’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and Other charges and Impairment of Goodwill. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between segment totals and consolidated Howmet are in Corporate. Following the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Howmet’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments as follows:Engine ProductsEngine Products produces investment castings, including airfoils, and seamless rolled rings primarily for aircraft engines and industrial gas turbines. Engine Products produces rotating parts as well as structural parts.Fastening SystemsFastening Systems produces aerospace fastening systems, as well as commercial transportation fasteners. The business’s high-tech, multi-material fastening systems are found nose to tail on aircraft and aero engines. The business’s products are also critical components of automobiles, commercial transportation vehicles, and construction and industrial equipment.62Table of ContentsEngineered StructuresEngineered Structures produces titanium ingots and mill products for aerospace and defense applications and is vertically integrated to produce titanium forgings, extrusions forming and machining services for airframe, wing, aero-engine, and landing gear components. Engineered Structures also produces aluminum forgings, nickel forgings, and aluminum machined components and assemblies for aerospace and defense applications.Forged WheelsForged Wheels provides forged aluminum wheels and related products for heavy-duty trucks and the commercial transportation markets.Goodwill     The Company had $4,102 of Goodwill at December 31, 2020, and the Company reviews it for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if indicators exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. On January 1, 2020, management transferred the Savannah business from the Engine Products segment to the Engineered Structures segment, based on synergies with forgings technologies and manufacturing capabilities. As a result of the reorganization, goodwill of $17 was reallocated from Engine Products to Engineered Structures, and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2020. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no goodwill impairment at the date the business was transferred. During the first quarter of 2020, Howmet's market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of our peer group companies, and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures designed to contain the spread, global sales to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries impacted by COVID-19 have been and are expected to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand. As a result of these macroeconomic factors, we performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value. As a result of this assessment, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test in the first quarter for the Engineered Structures reporting unit and concluded that though the margin between the fair value of the reporting unit and carrying value had declined from approximately 60% to approximately 15%, it was not impaired. Consistent with prior practice, a discounted cash flow model was used to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit. The significant assumptions and estimates utilized to determine fair value were developed utilizing current market and forecast information reflecting the disruption in demand that has and is expected to negatively impact the Company’s sales globally in the aerospace industry. If our actual results or external market factors decline significantly from management’s estimates, future goodwill impairment charges may be necessary and could be material. During the second and third quarters of 2020, there were no indicators of impairment identified for the Engineered Structures reporting unit.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note A).

H. Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsHowmet maintains pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in foreign locations. Pension benefits generally depend on length of service and job grade. Substantially all benefits are paid through pension trusts that are sufficiently funded to ensure that all plans can pay benefits to retirees as they become due. Most salaried and non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after March 1, 2006, participate in a defined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.Howmet also maintains health care and life insurance postretirement benefit plans covering eligible U.S. retired employees and certain retirees from foreign locations. Generally, the medical plans are unfunded and pay a percentage of medical expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life benefits are generally provided by insurance contracts. Howmet retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to change or eliminate these benefits. All salaried and certain non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2002 and certain bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after July 1, 2010, are not eligible for postretirement health care benefits. All salaried and certain hourly U.S. employees that retire on or after April 1, 2008 are not eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits. Effective May 1, 2019, salaried employees and retirees are not eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits.Effective January 1, 2015, Howmet no longer offers postretirement health care benefits to Medicare-eligible, primarily non-bargaining, U.S. retirees through Company-sponsored plans. Qualifying retirees (hired prior to January 1, 2002), both current and future, may access these benefits in the marketplace by purchasing coverage directly from insurance carriers.On April 1, 2018, benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company's qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly employees ceased. As a result of this change, in 2018, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued pension benefit liability of $136 related to the reduction of future benefits ($141 offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss) and curtailment charges of $5 in Restructuring and other charges.On April 13, 2018, the United Auto Workers ratified a new five-year labor agreement, covering approximately 1,300 U.S. employees, which expires on March 31, 2023. A provision within the agreement includes a retirement benefit increase for future retirees that participate in a defined benefit pension plan, which impacts approximately 300 of those employees. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, benefit accruals for future service of this group ceased. As result of these changes, in 2018, a curtailment charge of $9 was recorded in Restructuring and other charges. In 2018, the Company announced that effective December 31, 2018, it would end all pre-Medicare medical, prescription drug and vision coverage for current and future salaried and non-bargained hourly employees and retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries. As a result of this change, in 2018, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued other postretirement benefits 70Table of Contentsliability of $32 related to the reduction of future benefits, $4 offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and a curtailment benefit of $28 in Restructuring and other charges.In 2018, the company communicated to plan participants that effective in the first quarter of 2019, benefit accruals for future service and compensation for employees in the United Kingdom defined benefit pension plans will cease. The plan curtailment resulted in a $13 decrease in the Accrued pension benefits liability which was offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, on October 29, 2018, the United Kingdom High Court ruled that defined benefit pension plans offering Guaranteed Minimum Pensions must review benefits accrued between May 1990 to April 1997 to ensure gender pay equality. The review resulted in an increase to the Accrued pension benefits liability of $9 and a corresponding curtailment charge that was recorded in Restructuring and other charges.In 2019, the Company communicated to plan participants that for its U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries, it would eliminate the life insurance benefit effective May 1, 2019, and certain health care subsidies effective December 31, 2019. As a result of these changes, in 2019, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued other postretirement benefits liability of $75, which was offset by a curtailment benefit of $58 (of which $16 was recorded in Restructuring and other charges and $42 related to Arconic Corporation in Discontinued Operations) and $17 in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.In June 2019, the Company and the United Steelworkers (""USW"") reached a tentative three-year labor agreement that was ratified on July 11, 2019 covering approximately 3,400 employees at four U.S. locations of Arconic Corporation; the previous labor agreement expired on May 15, 2019. In 2019, the Company recognized $9 in Discontinued operations on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations primarily for a one-time signing bonus for employees. Additionally, on July 25, 2019, the USW ratified a new four-year labor agreement covering approximately 560 employees at the Company’s Niles, Ohio facility. The prior labor agreement expired on June 30, 2018.In 2020 and 2019, the Company applied settlement accounting to U.S. pension plans due to lump sum payments to participants which resulted in settlement charges of $8 and $9, respectively, that were recorded in Restructuring and other charges.In 2020 the Company undertook a number of actions to reduce pension obligations in the U.K. by offering lump sum payments to certain plan participants and entering into group annuity contracts with a third-party carrier to pay and administer future annuity payments which resulted in settlement charges of $66 that were recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. These actions reduced the number of pension plan participants in the U.K. by approximately half.In 2020, the Company communicated to plan participants that for its U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries, it would eliminate certain health care subsidies effective December 31, 2021, and that for certain bargained retirees of the Company, it would eliminate certain health care subsidies effective December 31, 2021 and the life insurance benefit effective August 1, 2020. As a result of these amendments, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued other postretirement benefits liability of $6 in 2020, which was offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.71Table of ContentsThe funded status of all of Howmet’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of December 31 each calendar year.Obligations and Funded Status Pension benefitsOtherpostretirement benefitsDecember 31,2020201920202019Change in benefit obligationBenefit obligation at beginning of year$7,249 $6,476 $786 $806 Transfer to Arconic Corporation(4,355)— (569)— Service cost6 25 2 7 Interest cost71 235 7 28 Amendments6 — (11)(78)Actuarial losses(1)313 974 14 100 Settlements(398)(23)— — Benefits paid(153)(477)(17)(82)Medicare Part D subsidy receipts— — 3 5 Foreign currency translation impact(26)39 — — Benefit obligation at end of year(2)$2,713 $7,249 $215 $786 Change in plan assets(2)Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$4,868 $4,334 $— $— Transfer to Arconic Corporation(2,982)— — — Actual return on plan assets203 731 — — Employer contributions227 268 — — Benefits paid(136)(453)— — Administrative expenses(12)(34)— — Settlement payments(413)(22)— — Foreign currency translation impact(31)44 — — Fair value of plan assets at end of year(2)$1,724 $4,868 $— $— Funded status$(989)$(2,381)$(215)$(786)Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of:Noncurrent assets$12 $41 $— $— Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations— 63 — — Current liabilities(16)(19)(17)(17)Current liabilities of discontinued operations— (7)— (55)Noncurrent liabilities(985)(1,030)(198)(200)Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations— (1,429)— (514)Net amount recognized$(989)$(2,381)$(215)$(786)Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:Net actuarial loss$1,274 $3,375 $22 $179 Prior service cost (benefit)6 1 (28)(37)Net amount recognized, before tax effect$1,280 $3,376 $(6)$142 Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:Net actuarial loss$166 $566 $14 $100 Amortization of accumulated net actuarial (loss) gain(123)(148)1 (8)Loss transferred to Arconic Corporation(2,144)— (170)— 72Table of ContentsPrior service cost (benefit)5 — (11)(78)Amortization of prior service (cost) benefit— (2)5 68 Prior service credit transferred to Arconic Corporation— — 13 — Net amount recognized, before tax effect$(2,096)$416 $(148)$82 (1)At December 31, 2020, the actuarial losses impacting the benefit obligation were due to changes in discount rate, alternative interest cost method and other changes including census data, partially offset by actual asset returns in excess of expected returns.(2)At December 31, 2020, the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status for U.S. pension plans were $2,327, $1,361, and $(966), respectively.

In 2019 and 2018, curtailments were due to a reduction of future benefits, resulting in the recognition of favorable and unfavorable plan amendments.(5)Service cost was included within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general administrative, and other expenses, and Research and development expenses; curtailments and settlements were included in Restructuring and other charges; and all other cost components were recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.AssumptionsWeighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows:December 31,20202019Discount rate2.40 %3.00 %Cash balance plan interest crediting rate3.00 %3.00 %The U.S. discount rate is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary while both the U.K. and Canada utilize models developed internally by their respective actuary. The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have a global average duration of 12 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times. Benefit accruals for future compensation under the Company’s major salaried and non-bargained hourly defined benefit pension plans have ceased. The rate of compensation increase no longer impacts the determination of the benefit obligation. Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows:202020192018Discount rate to calculate service cost(1)3.30 %4.30 %3.60 %Discount rate to calculate interest cost(1)2.70 %3.90 %3.30 %Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets6.00 %5.60 %5.90 %Rate of compensation increase(2)— %3.50 %3.50 %Cash balance plan interest crediting rate3.00 %3.00 %3.00 %(1)In all periods presented, the respective global discount rates were used to determine net periodic benefit cost for most pension plans for the full annual period. However, the discount rates for a limited number of plans were updated during 2020, 2019, and 2018 to reflect the remeasurement of these plans due to new union labor agreements, settlements, and/or curtailments. The updated discount rates used were not significantly different from the discount rates presented.(2)Benefit accruals for future compensation under the Company’s major salaried and non-bargained hourly defined benefit pension plans have ceased. The rate of compensation increase no longer impacts the determination of the benefit obligation.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (“EROA”) is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2020, 2019, and 2018, the U.S. expected long-term rate of return used by management was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2018, management reduced the expected long-term rate of return by 75 basis points to 7.00% for the U.S. Pension plans due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average. For 2021, management anticipates that 7.00% will continue to be the expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. Pension plans. EROA assumptions are developed by country. Annual changes in the weighted average EROA are impacted by the relative size of the assets by country.74Table of ContentsAssumed health care cost trend rates for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans were as follows:202020192018Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year5.50 %5.50 %5.50 %Rate to which the cost trend rate gradually declines4.50 4.50 4.50 Year that the rate reaches the rate at which it is assumed to remain202320232022The assumed health care cost trend rate is used to measure the expected cost of gross eligible charges covered by Howmet’s other postretirement benefit plans. For 2021, a 5.5% trend rate will be used, reflecting management’s best estimate of the change in future health care costs covered by the plans. The plans’ actual annual health care cost trend experience over the past three years has ranged from (3.8)% to 4.0%. Management does not believe this three-year range is indicative of expected increases for future health care costs over the long-term.Plan AssetsHowmet’s pension plans’ investment policy at December 31, 2020 by asset class, were as follows:  Asset classPolicy range(1)Equities20–55%Fixed income25–55%Other investments15–35%Total (1)Policy range is for U.S. plan assets only, as both the U.K. and Canadian asset investment allocations are controlled by a third-party trustee with input from Howmet.The principal objectives underlying the investment of the pension plans’ assets are to ensure that Howmet can properly fund benefit obligations as they become due under a broad range of potential economic and financial scenarios, maximize the long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on such obligations, and broadly diversify investments across and within various asset classes to protect asset values against adverse movements. Specific objectives for long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities and achieving diversification across the balance of the asset portfolio. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The investment strategy uses long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities. Exposure to broad equity risk is decreased and diversified through investments in discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds, long/short equity hedge funds, high yield bonds, emerging market debt and global and emerging market equities. Investments are further diversified by strategy, asset class, geography, and sector to enhance returns and mitigate downside risk. A large number of external investment managers are used to gain broad exposure to the financial markets and to mitigate manager-concentration risk.Investment practices comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA"") and other applicable laws and regulations.The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified (see Note S for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy).Equities. These securities consist of: (i) direct investments in the stock of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. companies, and equity derivatives, that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (ii) the plans’ share of commingled funds that are invested in the stock of publicly traded companies and are valued at the net asset value of shares held at December 31 (included in Level 1 and Level 2); and (iii) direct investments in long/short equity hedge funds and private equity (limited partnerships and venture capital partnerships) that are valued at net asset value.Fixed income. These securities consist of: (i) U.S. government debt that are generally valued using quoted prices (included in Level 1); (ii) cash and cash equivalents invested in publicly-traded funds and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (iii) publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally corporate bonds and debentures) and are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data (included in Level 2); (iv) fixed income derivatives that are generally valued using industry standard models with market-based observable inputs (included in Level 2); and (v) cash and cash equivalents invested in institutional funds and are valued at net asset value.75Table of ContentsOther investments. These investments include, among others: (i) exchange traded funds, such as gold, and real estate investment trusts and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the investments are traded (included in Level 1) and (ii) direct investments of discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds and private real estate (includes limited partnerships) and are valued at net asset value.The fair value methods described above may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Additionally, while Howmet believes the valuation methods used by the plans’ trustees are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.The following table presents the fair value of pension plan assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy or net asset value:December 31, 2020Level 1Level 2Net Asset ValueTotalEquities:Equity securities$274 $89 $68 $431 Long/short equity hedge funds— — 77 77 Private equity— — 87 87 $274 $89 $232 $595 Fixed income:Intermediate and long duration government/credit$78 $579 $31 $688 Other63 254 — 317  $141 $833 $31 $1,005 Other investments:Real estate$31 $— $52 $83 Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds— — 94 94 Other— — 23 23  $31 $— $169 $200 Net plan assets(1)$446 $922 $432 $1,800 December 31, 2019Level 1Level 2Net Asset ValueTotalEquitiesEquity securities$590 $— $508 $1,098 Long/short equity hedge funds— — 260 260 Private equity— — 155 155 $590 $— $923 $1,513 Fixed income:Intermediate and long duration government/credit$121 $1,047 $1,003 $2,171 Other126 7 144 277  $247 $1,054 $1,147 $2,448 Other investments:Real estate$104 $— $165 $269 Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds— — 405 405 Other— — 240 240  $104 $— $810 $914 Net plan assets(2)$941 $1,054 $2,880 $4,875 (1)As of December 31, 2020, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net payable of $76, which represents securities purchased and sold but not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.(2)As of December 31, 2019, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net receivable of $7, which represents securities purchased and sold but not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.76Table of ContentsFunding and Cash FlowsIt is Howmet’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Howmet contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. In 2020 and 2019, cash contributions to Howmet’s pension plans were $227 and $268, respectively, which includes $25 and $53, respectively, contributed to the Company’s U.S. plans that was in excess of the minimum required under ERISA.The contributions to the Company’s pension plans in 2021 are estimated to be $140 (of which $130 is for U.S. plans), all of which are minimum required contributions. During the third quarter of 2016, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation approved management’s plan to separate the Alcoa Inc. pension plans between the Company and Alcoa Corporation. The plan stipulated that the Company make cash contributions of $150 over a period of 30 months (from November 1, 2016) to its two largest pension plans. The Company satisfied the requirements of the plan by making payments of $34, $66, and $50 in April 2019, March 2018, and April 2017, respectively.Benefit payments expected to be paid to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ participants and expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts are as follows utilizing the current assumptions outlined above:For the year ended December 31,Pensionbenefits paidGross Other post-retirementbenefitsLess Medicare Part Dsubsidy receiptsNet Other post-retirementbenefits2021$168 $17 $1 $16 2022169 16 1 15 2023164 16 1 15 2024160 15 1 14 2025158 15 1 14 2026 - 2030728 67 6 61  $1,547 $146 $11 $135 Defined Contribution PlansHowmet sponsors savings and investment plans in various countries, primarily in the U.S. Howmet’s contributions and expenses related to these plans were $73, $87, and $85 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, and Howmet matches a portion of these contributions in equivalent form of the investments elected by the employee.I.

The Company recorded a $30 benefit related to this tax law change. In 2018, the Company finalized its accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""the 2017 Act”) and recorded an additional $59 charge. (3)In 2020, a $104 valuation allowance was recorded related to deferred tax assets that were previously subject to a reserve that was otherwise released in 2020 as a result of a favorable Spanish tax case decision. In 2019, the Company released a $112 valuation allowance related to 2015 and 2016 foreign tax credits, subsequent to filing U.S. amended tax returns to deduct, rather than credit, foreign taxes.(4)In 2020, the Company released a $64 reserve liability and a $104 reserve recorded as a contra balance against deferred tax assets as a result of a favorable Spanish tax case decision. A $30 benefit related to a previously uncertain U.S. tax position was also recognized in 2020. In 2018, the tax charge to establish the reserves related to the Spanish tax matter was partially offset by a $38 benefit related to a foreign reserve that was effectively settled.(5)In 2019, the Company filed U.S. amended tax returns to deduct, rather than credit, 2015 and 2016 foreign taxes resulting in a $112 tax cost associated with the write-off of the deferred tax asset for the credit, partially offset by a $24 tax benefit for the deduction.78Table of ContentsOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017. Also on December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was issued by the SEC to address the application of U.S. GAAP for financial reporting. SAB 118 permitted the use of provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates in the financial statements. SAB 118 also provided that the tax impact may be considered incomplete in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act.The Company calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the 2017 Act’s tax rate reduction and one-time transition tax in its 2017 year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the 2017 Act and guidance available and, as a result, recorded a $272 tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.In 2018, the Company included a $59 tax charge in income from continuing operations as a result of finalizing its accounting for the 2017 Tax Act in accordance with SAB 118. This charge primarily related to a $16 charge for the one-time transition tax and a $43 charge to update deferred tax balances.The components of net deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: 20202019December 31,DeferredtaxassetsDeferredtaxliabilitiesDeferredtaxassetsDeferredtaxliabilitiesDepreciation$21 $506 $10 $480 Employee benefits364 — 368 6 Loss provisions24 1 36 — Deferred income/expense41 1,033 48 939 Interest3 — 56 — Tax loss carryforwards3,267 — 2,819 — Tax credit carryforwards378 — 379 — Other7 13 23 — $4,105 $1,553 $3,739 $1,425 Valuation allowance(2,307)— (2,121)—  $1,798 $1,553 $1,618 $1,425 The following table details the expiration periods of the deferred tax assets presented above:December 31, 2020Expireswithin10 yearsExpireswithin11-20 yearsNoExpiration(1)Other(2)TotalTax loss carryforwards$378 $262 $2,627 $— $3,267 Tax credit carryforwards299 66 13 — 378 Other(3)— — 389 71 460 Valuation allowance(644)(161)(1,479)(23)(2,307) $33 $167 $1,550 $48 $1,798 (1)Deferred tax assets with no expiration may still have annual limitations on utilization.(2)Other represents deferred tax assets whose expiration is dependent upon the reversal of the underlying temporary difference.(3)A substantial amount of Other deferred tax assets relates to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes in jurisdictions with unlimited expiration over an extended period of time as contributions are made to employee benefit plans and payments are made to retirees.The total deferred tax asset (net of valuation allowance) is supported by projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences (15%) and taxable temporary differences that reverse within the carryforward period (85%).79Table of ContentsValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Howmet’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, the Company made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI income inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Howmet’s foreign tax credits in the United States have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2021 to 2029 (as of December 31, 2020). Valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period. After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies, an incremental valuation allowance of $46 was recognized in 2018. No additional valuation allowance was recorded in 2020 and 2019 as the Company intends to deduct, rather than credit, foreign taxes. Foreign tax credits of $88 and $8 expired at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance was also reduced by $113 in 2019 as a result of the Company filing amended tax returns to deduct foreign taxes that were previously claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit. At December 31, 2020, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $216. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.In 2020, the Company reversed $1 of valuation allowance recorded in 2019 related to capital losses utilized in the 2019 tax return. The Company also recorded a valuation allowance of $9 related to capital investments in 2019. Capital losses can only offset capital gain income. Howmet does not anticipate sufficient future sources of capital gain income to support the utilization future capital losses on these investments. The need for valuation allowances against capital investments will be reassessed on a continuing basis.The Company recorded a $20 increase and $11 decrease to U.S. state valuation allowances in 2020 and 2019, respectively. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determined the adjustments based on the underlying net deferred tax assets that were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income. Changes in fully reserved U.S. state tax losses, credits and other deferred tax assets resulting from expirations, audit adjustments, tax rate, and tax law changes also resulted in a corresponding $58 decrease and $5 increase in the valuation allowance in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Valuation allowances of $609 remain against state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization. The need for valuation allowances against state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. In 2020, the Company increased a valuation allowance by $104 as a result of releasing a tax reserve following a favorable Spanish tax case decision. In 2018, the Company had reduced a valuation allowance by $92 as a result of increasing a tax reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to the same Spanish tax case. The valuation allowance reduction was partially offset by a $20 charge with respect to losses no longer supported by reversing temporary differences. The Company also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $61 in 2018, which offset a deferred tax asset recorded for additional losses reported on the Spanish tax return related to the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction that are not more likely than not to be realized.80Table of ContentsThe following table details the changes in the valuation allowance:December 31,202020192018Balance at beginning of year$2,121 $2,357 $2,459 Increase to allowance136 19 119 Release of allowance(50)(211)(144)Acquisitions and divestitures— (2)— Tax apportionment, tax rate and tax law changes(23)(13)(14)Foreign currency translation123 (29)(63)Balance at end of year$2,307 $2,121 $2,357 As a result of the 2017 Act, the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (calculated based on U.S. tax principles) of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations has been subject to U.S. tax under the one-time transition tax provisions. The 2017 Act also created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, GILTI, must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. The 2017 Act also established the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (""BEAT""). In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a final accounting policy election to treat taxes due from future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Howmet has estimated a GILTI inclusion for 2020, 2019, and 2018 and recorded tax expense accordingly. Howmet does not anticipate being subject to BEAT for these years.Foreign U.S. GAAP earnings that have not otherwise been subject to U.S. tax, will generally be exempt from future U.S. tax under the 2017 Act when distributed. Such distributions, as well as distributions of previously taxed foreign earnings, could potentially be subject to U.S. state tax in certain states, and foreign withholding taxes. Foreign currency gains/losses related to the translation of previously taxed earnings from functional currency to U.S. dollars could also be subject to U.S. tax when distributed. At this time, Howmet has no plans to distribute such earnings in the foreseeable future. If such earnings were to be distributed, Howmet would expect the potential U.S. state tax and withholding tax impacts to be immaterial and the potential deferred tax liability associated with future foreign currency gains to be impracticable to determine.Howmet and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With a few minor exceptions, Howmet is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2011. All U.S. tax years prior to 2020 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining the Company’s income tax returns for various tax years through 2019.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was as follows:December 31,202020192018Balance at beginning of year$176 $148 $50 Additions for tax positions of the current year— 34 — Additions for tax positions of prior years— — 143 Reductions for tax positions of prior years(182)(1)(38)Settlements with tax authorities(1)— — Expiration of the statute of limitations— (2)(6)Foreign currency translation9 (3)(1)Balance at end of year$2 $176 $148 For all periods presented, a portion of the balance pertains to state tax liabilities, which are presented before any offset for federal tax benefits. The effect of unrecognized tax benefits, if recorded, that would impact the annual effective tax rate for 2020, 2019, and 2018 would be approximately 1%, 36%, and 11%, respectively, of pre-tax book income. Howmet does not anticipate that changes in its unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations during 2021.It is Howmet’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the Provision for income taxes on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. Howmet recognized interest of $2, $6, and $22 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, settlements with tax authorities, reductions in prior accruals and refunded overpayments, Howmet recognized interest income of $25, $0, and $1 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the amount accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was $2, $23, and $21, respectively.81Table of ContentsJ. Preferred and Common StockPreferred Stock. Howmet has two classes of preferred stock: $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock (""Class A Preferred Stock"") and Class B Serial Preferred Stock. Class A Preferred Stock has 660,000 shares authorized at a par value of $100 per share with an annual $3.75 cumulative dividend preference per share. There were 546,024 shares of Class A Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Class B Serial Preferred Stock has 10,000,000 shares authorized as a par value of $1 per share. There were no shares of Class B Serial Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019.Common Stock. At December 31, 2020, there were 600,000,000 shares authorized and 432,906,377 shares issued and outstanding. Dividends paid were $0.02 per share in 2020 (all in the first quarter of 2020) and $0.12 per share in 2019 ($0.06 dividend in the first quarter of 2019 and $0.02 per quarter for the remainder of the year) and $0.24 per share in 2018, or $0.06 per quarter in 2018.As of December 31, 2020, 47 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under Howmet’s stock-based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2020, 33 million shares remain available for issuance. Howmet issues new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options and the conversion of stock awards.In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI International Metals Inc. (""RTI""), the Company assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche was due and settled in cash on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403). No shares of the Company’s common stock were issued in connection with the maturity or final conversion of this convertible debt.

On May 14, 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 of its outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the share repurchase programs previously authorized by the Board, the Company entered into an ASR agreement on August 6, 2019 with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to repurchase $200 of its common stock (the ""August 2019 ASR""). In November 2019, the Company repurchased $50 of its common stock on the open market. In August/September 2020 and in November 2020, the Company repurchased $51 and $22, respectively, of its common stock on the open market.Shares repurchased during 2020 and 2019 were $73 and $1,150, respectively. All of the shares repurchased during 2020 and 2019 were immediately retired. After giving effect to the share repurchases made through December 31, 2020, approximately $277 remains available under the prior authorizations by the Board for share repurchases. The amount of share repurchases by the Company may be limited under the terms of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement.

Stock options are granted at the closing market price of Howmet’s common stock on the date of grant and typically vest over a three-year service period (1/3 each year) with a ten-year contractual term. Restricted stock unit awards typically vest over a three-year service period from the date of grant. As part of Howmet’s stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. Certain of the restricted stock unit awards include performance and market conditions and are granted to certain eligible employees. In 2020 and 2019, performance stock awards were granted to a senior executive that vest either based on achievement of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (see Note C for further details) or the achievement of certain stock price thresholds. For performance stock awards granted to other employees in 2020, the final number of shares earned will be based on Howmet’s achievement of profitability targets over the respective performance periods and will be earned at the end of the third year. Performance stock awards granted in the first quarter of 2019 were converted to restricted stock unit awards (at target), in order to address the pending Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction. For performance stock awards granted in 2018, in order to address the pending Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the final number of shares earned will be based on Howmet’s achievement of sales and profitability targets over performance periods in 2018 and 2019. Additionally, the 2020 and 2018 performance stock awards will be scaled by a total shareholder return (""TSR"") multiplier, which depends upon relative performance against the TSRs of a group of peer companies.In conjunction with their employment agreements, certain current and former executives were granted cash bonus awards based on the achievement of certain stock price thresholds. These awards are liability classified and were marked-to-market each quarter using a Monte Carlo simulation. The stock price thresholds have been fully reached. The cash payment of $23 will occur in 2021 in accordance with the terms of the agreements.In 2020, 2019, and 2018, Howmet recognized stock-based compensation expense of $46 ($42 after-tax), $69 ($63 after-tax), and $40 ($31 after-tax), respectively. Senior executive performance awards granted in April 2020 were modified in June 2020, resulting in incremental compensation expense of $12, which will be amortized over the remaining service period ending April 1, 2023. Additionally, the effect of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction was a modification of the original stock options and restricted stock award units. The modifications were designed with the intention that the intrinsic value of the stock option or stock award were the same both previous to and after the adjustments. An immaterial charge was recorded to Restructuring and other charges related to the modification. Over 95% of compensation expense recorded in 2020 relates to restricted stock unit awards. Cash bonus awards of $2 and $21 were recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of the remaining stock-based compensation expense in 2019, more than 95% relates to restricted stock unit awards. The expense related to restricted stock unit awards in 2018 was approximately 80%. No stock-based compensation expense was capitalized in any of those years. Stock-based compensation expense was reduced by $3 in 2019 for certain executive pre-vest cancellations which were recorded in Restructuring and other charges within the Statement of Consolidated Operations. At December 31, 2020, there was $51 (pre-tax) of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants and non-vested restricted stock unit award grants. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.83Table of ContentsStock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of the applicable equity grant. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value was equivalent to the closing market price of Howmet’s common stock on the date of grant.  The weighted average grant date fair value of the 2020 performance stock awards with a market condition scaled by a TSR multiplier was $21.33, and the weighted average grant date fair value of the April 2020 senior executive performance stock awards with a market condition (achievement of certain stock price thresholds) was $2.57. The weighted average grant date fair value of the 2019 performance stock awards with a market condition (achievement of certain stock price thresholds) was $11.93. The grant date fair value of the 2018 performance stock awards containing a market condition (scaled by TSR multiplier) was $20.25. The 2020, 2019 and 2018 performance awards were valued using a Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo simulation uses assumptions of stock price behavior to estimate the probability of satisfying market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The risk-free interest rate (0.3% in 2020, 1.6% in 2019 and in 2.7% 2018) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the remaining performance period. In 2020 volatility was estimated using a blended rate of Howmet's historical volatility and a peer-based volatility (48.3%) due to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and the related changes in the nature of the business. In 2019 volatility was estimated using implied and historical volatility (33.4%). Because of limited historical information due to the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction, 2018 volatility (32.0%) was estimated using implied volatility, and the representative price return approach, which uses price returns of comparable companies, was used to develop a correlation assumption. For stock options, the fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model, which generated a result of $9.79 per option in 2018. There were no stock options issued in 2020 or 2019. The lattice-pricing model uses a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value of a stock option, including a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, exercise behavior, and contractual life. The following paragraph describes in detail the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2018.The risk-free interest rate (2.5%) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the contractual life of the option. The dividend yield (0.9%) was based on a one-year average. Volatility (34.0%) was based on comparable companies and implied volatilities over the term of the option. Howmet utilized historical option forfeiture data to estimate annual post-vesting forfeitures (6%). Exercise behavior (61%) was based on a weighted average exercise ratio (exercise patterns for grants issued over the number of years in the contractual option term) of an option’s intrinsic value resulting from historical employee exercise behavior. Based upon the other assumptions used in the determination of the fair value, the life of an option (6.0) was an output of the lattice-pricing mod. The activity for stock options and stock awards during 2020 was as follows (options and awards in millions): Stock optionsStock awards  Number ofoptionsWeightedaverageexercise priceNumber ofawardsWeightedaverage FMVper awardOutstanding, December 31, 20197 $25.75 7 $22.05 Granted — — 6 10.89 Exercised(2)21.65 — — Converted— — (4)19.54 Expired or forfeited(1)30.12 — 19.57 Canceled due to Arconic Inc.

Additionally, 3.1 million of the stock options outstanding were fully vested and exercisable and had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.8 years, a weighted average exercise price of $24.32, and a total intrinsic value of $18 as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, the cash received from stock option exercises was $33, $56, and $16 and the total tax benefit realized from these exercises was $3, $4, and $2, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $14, $17, and $7, respectively.84Table of ContentsK.

ReceivablesSale of Receivables ProgramThe Company has two accounts receivables securitization arrangements.The first is an arrangement with financial institutions to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis (""Receivables Sale Program""). The sale of such receivables is completed using a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. This arrangement historically provided up to a maximum funding of $400 for receivables sold. The Company maintains a beneficial interest, or a right to collect cash, on the sold receivables that have not been funded (deferred purchase program receivable). In the first quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to remove subsidiaries of the GRP business from the sale of receivables program in preparation for the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and repurchased the remaining $282 unpaid receivables of GRP customers in a non-cash transaction by reducing the amount of the deferred purchase program receivable. This amendment also reduced the maximum funding for receivables sold to $300. Effective September 30, 2020, the concentration limit of one customer may be reduced at the discretion of the financial institutions or automatically upon the downgrade of its debt rating as defined in the Receivables Sale Program agreement. A reduction in the customer's concentration limit would reduce the eligible receivable funding base thereby reducing the amount of future draws available and may also require repayment of a portion of existing draws.The Company had net cash repayments totaling $146 ($207 in draws and $353 in repayments) in 2020 and net cash repayments totaling $0 ($600 in draws and $600 in repayments) in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the deferred purchase program receivable was $12 and $246, respectively, which was included in Other receivables on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase program receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase program receivable. The Company services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded.On April 14, 2020, the Company’s credit rating was downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., which resulted in a termination event under the provisions of the Receivables Sale Program agreement for which a waiver was obtained. This termination event under the Receivables Sale Program is not an event of default under the Company’s other financing and commercial agreements, including the Credit Agreement. On May 5, 2020, an amendment to the Receivables Sale Program was executed that cured the termination event.Cash receipts from customer payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have been previously sold in this program) as well as cash receipts and cash disbursements from draws and repayments under the program are presented as cash receipts from sold receivables within investing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.The second arrangement is one in which the Company, through a wholly-owned special purpose entity (“SPE”), entered into an receivables purchase agreement (the “Receivables Purchase Agreement”) on June 30, 2020 such that the SPE may sell certain receivables to financial institutions until the earlier of June 30, 2021 or a termination event. The Receivables Purchase Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred receivables, and therefore accounts for these transfers as sales of receivables.The SPE sold $165 of its receivables without recourse and received cash funding under this program in 2020, resulting in derecognition of the receivables from the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (of which $46 remained outstanding from the customer at December 31, 2020 and $0 was in the program at December 31, 2019). Cash received from collections of sold receivables is used by the SPE to fund additional purchases of receivables on a revolving basis, not to exceed $125, which is the aggregate maximum limit. As collateral against the sold receivables, the SPE maintains a certain level of unsold receivables, which was $33 at December 31, 2020. Costs associated with the sales of receivables are reflected in the Company’s Consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which the sales occur. Cash receipts from sold receivables under the Receivables Purchase Agreement are presented within operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.87Table of ContentsThe Company had accounts receivable securitization arrangements totaling $425 at December 31, 2020, of which $250 was drawn. The Company had accounts receivable securitization arrangements totaling $400 at December 31, 2019, of which $350 was drawn. The $100 reduction in the amount drawn resulted in a corresponding reduction in Cash and cash equivalents. Other Customer Receivable SalesIn 2020, the Company sold $32 of a certain customer’s receivables in exchange for cash (of which $0 remained outstanding from the customer at December 31, 2020), the proceeds from which are presented in changes in receivables within operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. The sale of these customer receivables partially offset the maximum funding reduction resulting from the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction as well as customer concentration limits within the first accounts receivable securitization arrangement. In 2020, the Company sold another customer’s receivables of $149 in exchange for cash (of which $50 remained outstanding from the customer at December 31, 2020), the proceeds from which are presented in changes in receivables within operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. The sale of these customer receivables was undertaken to offset a change in the customer’s payment patterns (customer had been taking a discount for paying early).Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe following table details the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to customer receivables and other receivables: Customer receivablesOther receivables202020192018202020192018Balance at beginning of year$1 $1 $3 $15 $15 $15 Provision for doubtful accounts1 2 — 3 7 2 Write off of uncollectible accounts— (1)(2)(1)(2)(1)Recoveries of prior write-offs— — — (1)(3)(3)Other(1)(1)— 3 (2)2 Balance at end of year$1 $1 $1 $19 $15 $15 N.

The carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the Disks asset group long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the long-lived assets, with fair value determined using a DCF model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence. The impairment charge of $428, of which $247 and $181 related to the Engine Products and Engineered Structures segments, respectively, recorded in the second quarter of 2019 impacted properties, plants, and equipment; intangible assets; and certain other noncurrent assets by $198, $197, and $33, respectively. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2019.Depreciation expense related to Properties, plants and equipment recorded in Provision for depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations was $236, $234, and $253 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.89Table of ContentsP.

On January 15, 2021 the Company completed the early redemption of all the remaining $361 of its 5.400% Notes due in April 2021 (the “5.400% Notes”) at par and paid $5 in accrued interest. On an annual basis, the redemption of these Notes will decrease Interest expense, net by approximately $19.On May 21, 2020, the Company completed a cash tender offer and redeemed $589 and $151 of principal amount of the 5.400% Notes and its 5.870% Notes due 2022, respectively. The amount of early tender premium and accrued interest and associated with the notes accepted for early settlement were $24 and $4, respectively, which was recorded in Interest expense, net during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended September 30, 2020 in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.On April 24, 2020, the Company completed an offering of $1,200 aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Notes due 2025, the proceeds of which have been used to fund the cash tender offers noted above and to pay related transaction fees, including applicable premiums and expenses, with the remaining amount to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company incurred deferred financing costs of $14 associated with the issuance in the second quarter of 2020.On April 16, 2020, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective automatically (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Shelf Registration Statement allows for offerings of debt securities from time to time.On April 6, 2020, the Company completed the early redemption of all $1,000 of its 6.150% Notes due 2020 (the ""6.150% Notes"") and the early partial redemption of $300 of its 5.400% Notes. Holders of the 6.150% Notes were paid an aggregate of $1,020 and holders of the 5.400% Notes were paid an aggregate of $315, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. The Company incurred early termination premium and accrued interest of $35 and $17, respectively, which has been recorded in Interest expense, net during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended September 30, 2020 in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.On October 15, 2019, the 1.63% Convertible Notes matured in accordance with their terms and the Company repaid in cash the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $403 together with accrued and unpaid interest.During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the early redemption of its remaining outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019, with aggregate principal amount of $500, for $518 in cash including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $19 in Interest expense in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for 2018 primarily for the premium paid on the early redemption of these notes in excess of their carrying value.92Table of ContentsThe Company has the option to redeem certain of its Notes and Bonds in whole or part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, plus in either case accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.Credit Facilities. On July 25, 2014, Howmet entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein, which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). By an Extension Request and Amendment Letter dated as of June 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to July 25, 2020. On September 16, 2016, Howmet entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement to permit the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement, including the replacement of the existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment No. 2”) to amend and restate the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as so amended and restated, is herein referred to as the “Credit Agreement.”On March 4, 2020, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement. The amendment was entered into to permit the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement, including a change to the existing financial covenant and reduction of total commitments available from $3,000 to $1,500, effective April 1, 2020 and extended the maturity date from June 29, 2023 to April 1, 2025. The Company was required to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be no greater than  3.50 to 1.00.  On June 26, 2020, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement to provide relief from its existing financial covenant through December 31, 2021 and reduce total commitment available from $1,500 to $1,000. The Company is required to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters of the Company most recently ended, to be no greater than (i) 5.00  to 1.00 for any quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2020, (ii)  5.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, (iii) 5.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ending June 30, 2021, (iv) 4.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ending September 30, 2021, and (v) 4.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ending December 31, 2021. The ratio returns to 3.50 to 1.00 for all periods thereafter. Under Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement, during the covenant relief period from June 30, 2020 through December 31, 2021 (unless the Company ends the covenant relief period earlier in accordance with the amendment), common stock dividends and share repurchases are permitted only if no borrowings under the Credit Agreement are outstanding at the time and are limited to an aggregate amount of $100 through June 30, 2021, with such limit increasing by $150 to an aggregate amount of $250 after June 30, 2021 if the Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio is no greater than 3.75 to 1.00. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Availability under the Credit Agreement could be reduced in future periods if the Company fails to maintain the required ratios referenced above.The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Howmet’s ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Howmet’s ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Howmet’s ability to change the nature of its business.The Credit Facility matures on April 1, 2025, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Howmet may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Howmet will pay a fee of 0.30% per annum (based on Howmet’s current long-term debt ratings) of the total commitment to maintain the Credit Facility.The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Howmet. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Howmet’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin during the covenant relief period on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 1.20% and 2.20% per annum, respectively, through June 30, 2021; and 0.95% and 1.95% per annum, respectively, for the period from June 30, 2021 through December 31,2021, based on Howmet’s current long-term debt ratings.  The applicable margin in 2022 and thereafter on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.70% and 1.70% per annum, respectively, based on Howmet’s current long-term debt ratings. The applicable margin during and after the covenant relief period is subject to change based on the Company’s long-term debt ratings. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.  The obligation of Howmet to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) non-payment of obligations; (b) breach of any representation or warranty in any material respect; (c) non-performance of covenants and obligations; (d) with respect to other indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100, a default thereunder that causes such 93Table of Contentsindebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity or a default in the payment at maturity of any principal of such indebtedness; (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Howmet; and (f) a change in control of Howmet.There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and no amounts were borrowed during 2020, 2019, or 2018 under the Credit Agreement.In addition to the Credit Agreement, the Company had several other credit agreements that provided a borrowing capacity of $640 as of December 31, 2019, and all of which expired in 2020. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements was to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in these arrangements were the same as the Credit Agreement. In 2020, nothing was borrowed or repaid under these arrangements. In 2019 and 2018, Howmet borrowed and repaid $400 and $600, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2019 and 2018 were 3.7%, and 3.3%, respectively, and 49 days and 46 days, respectively.Short-Term Debt. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, short-term debt was $14 and $31, respectively, substantially all of which related to accounts payable settlement arrangements with certain vendors and third-party intermediaries. These arrangements provide that, at the vendor’s request, the third-party intermediary advances the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropriate discount, before the scheduled payment date, and Howmet makes payment to the third-party intermediary on the date stipulated in accordance with the commercial terms negotiated with its vendors. Howmet records imputed interest related to these arrangements in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.Commercial Paper. Howmet had no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2020 and 2019. In 2020 and 2019, Howmet did not issue commercial paper. In 2018, the average outstanding commercial paper was $49. Commercial paper matured at various times in 2018 and had an annual weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during 2018.S. Other Financial InstrumentsFair Value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (ii) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:•Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Derivatives, Noncurrent receivables, and Short-term debt included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair value. The Company holds exchange-traded fixed income securities which are considered available-for-sale securities that are carried at fair value which is based on quoted market prices which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of Long-term debt, less amounts due within one year was based on quoted market prices for public debt and on interest rates that are currently available to Howmet for issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities for non-public debt. The fair value amounts for all Long-term debt were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 20202019December 31,CarryingvalueFairvalueCarryingvalueFairvalueLong-term debt, less amounts due within one year$4,699 $5,426 $4,906 $5,337 Restricted cash was $1, $55 (see Note U), and $6 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.94Table of ContentsT.

Acquisitions and Divestitures2020 DivestituresOn January 31, 2020, the Company reached an agreement to sell a small manufacturing plant within the Engineered Structures segment for $12 in cash and therefore was classified as held for sale. However, as the sale did not close, the Company changed the classification of the assets from held for sale to held for use and recorded these assets at their lower of carrying value (assuming no initial reclassification for held for sale was made) or fair value. The result was a $5 non-cash impairment in 2020 which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.2019 Divestitures On May 31, 2019, the Company sold a small additive manufacturing facility within the Engineered Structures segment for $1 in cash, which resulted in a loss of $13 recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2019.On August 15, 2019, the Company sold inventories and properties, plants, and equipment related to a small energy business within the Engineered Structures segment for $13 in cash. The Company recognized a charge of $10 related to inventory impairment and recorded the charge in Cost of goods sold in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2019.On December 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its forgings business in the United Kingdom (U.K.) for $64 in cash, which resulted in a loss on sale of $46 which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2019. The Company settled certain post-closing adjustments which resulted in a $5 reduction in the purchase price and an additional loss of sale which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2020. The sale remains subject to certain tax post-closing adjustments. Of the cash proceeds received, $53 was recorded as Restricted cash within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 as its use is subject to restriction by the U.K. pension authority until certain U.K. pension plan changes have been made and approved. The restriction on these proceeds was removed in the second quarter of 2020. The forgings business primarily produces steel, titanium, and nickel based forged components for aerospace, mining, and off-highway markets and its operating results and assets and liabilities were included in the Engine Products segment. This business generated third party sales of $116, and $126 in 2019 and 2018, and had 540 employees at the time of divestiture.2018 Divestitures On December 31, 2018, as part of the Company’s then ongoing strategy and portfolio review, Howmet completed the sale of its forgings business in Hungary to Angstrom Automotive Group LLC for $2, which resulted in a loss of $43 recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2018. While owned by Howmet, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the Engine Products segment. This business generated sales of $32 in 2018 and had 180 employees at the time of the divestiture.V. Contingencies and CommitmentsContingenciesEnvironmental Matters. Howmet participates in environmental assessments and cleanups at more than 30 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""CERCLA"")) sites.A liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs. The liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, and technological changes, among others.95Table of ContentsThe Company's remediation reserve balance was $10 at December 31, 2020 and $8 at December 31, 2019 recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (of which $5 and $3, respectively, were classified as a current liability), and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. Payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were $2 in 2020 and $3 in 2019 and included expenditures currently mandated, as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party. Included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs. These costs are estimated to be less than 1% of Cost of goods sold.The Company previously reported on a remediation project related to the Grasse River, which is adjacent to the Massena West, New York plant site that is now part of Arconic Corporation. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between the Company and Arconic Corporation, dated as of March 31, 2020, Arconic Corporation agreed to assume and indemnify the Company against potential liabilities associated with the Grasse River remediation project. Therefore, the Company will no longer report on the Grasse River matter unless and until some event in the future causes it to become material and reportable.Tax. As previously reported, in July 2013, following a Spanish corporate income tax audit covering the 2006 through 2009 tax years, an assessment was received mainly disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. The Company appealed this assessment to Spain's Central Tax Administrative Court, and subsequently to Spain's National Court, each of which was denied. The Company then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Spain. In November 2020, the Supreme Court of Spain rendered a decision in favor of the taxpayer, removing the assessment in its entirety. The decision is final and cannot be further appealed. As a result of the favorable decision, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company released an income tax reserve, including interest, of $64 (€54), which was recorded in Provision (benefit) for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, that was previously established in the third quarter of 2018. In addition, the Company reversed a combined indemnification receivable of $53 (€45) for Alcoa Corporation's 49% share and Arconic Corporation's 33.66% share of the total reserve, which was recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, that were previously established pursuant to the October 31, 2016 and March 31, 2020 Tax Matters Agreements, respectively. As of the end of 2020, the Company no longer has a balance recorded for this matter.Reynobond PE. Prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction on April 1, 2020, the Company was known as Arconic Inc. References to “Arconic Inc.” in this “Reynobond PE” section refer to Arconic Inc. only and do not include its subsidiaries, except as otherwise stated.On June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, U.K. caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic Inc., Arconic Architectural Products SAS (""AAP SAS"") (now a subsidiary of Arconic Corporation as a result of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic Inc. nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metropolitan Police Service (the “Police”), a Public Inquiry by the British government and a consumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. The Public Inquiry was announced by the U.K. Prime Minister on June 15, 2017 and subsequently was authorized to examine the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire in order to make findings of fact and recommendations to the U.K. Government on matters such as the design, construction and modification of the building, the role of relevant public authorities and contractors, the implications of the fire for the adequacy and enforcement of relevant regulations, arrangements in place for handling emergencies and the handling of concerns from residents, among other things. Hearings for Phase 1 of the Public Inquiry began on May 21, 2018 and concluded on December 12, 2018. Phase 2 hearings of the Public Inquiry began in early 2020, following which a final report will be written and subsequently published. AAP SAS is participating as a Core Participant in the Public Inquiry and is also cooperating with the ongoing parallel investigation by the Police. Arconic Corporation does not sell and Arconic Inc. previously stopped selling the PE product for architectural use on buildings. Given the preliminary nature of these investigations and the uncertainty of potential future litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2020, Arconic Corporation agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities and the Company agreed to indemnify Arconic Corporation for certain liabilities. As a result of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation holds the building and construction systems businesses previously held by the Company and AAP SAS is a subsidiary of Arconic Corporation; accordingly, Arconic Corporation has 96Table of Contentsagreed to assume and indemnify the Company against potential liabilities associated with the June 13, 2017 fire at the Grenfell Tower in London, U.K., including the following legal proceedings in which Arconic Inc. and/or its then directors were named as parties:  United Kingdom Litigation. On December 23, 2020, claimant groups comprised of survivors and estates of decedents of the Grenfell Tower fire filed claims in the U.K. arising from that fire, against 23 defendants, including Howmet Aerospace Inc., AAP SAS, Arconic Corporation, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation Ltd, the London Fire Commissioner, the UK Home Office, The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Rydon Maintenance Ltd, Celotex Ltd, Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK Limited, Kingspan Insulation Limited, Kingspan Group PLC, Studio E Architects Ltd (in liquidation), Harley Facades Ltd, Harley Curtain Wall Limited (in liquidation), CEP Architectural Facades Ltd, Exova (U.K.) Ltd, CS Stokes & Associates Ltd, Artelia Projects UK Limited, Whirlpool UK Appliances Limited, Whirlpool Company Polska Sp.z.o.o. and Whirlpool Corporation. The Company has not yet been served with the claims and, therefore, currently does not have information regarding claimants’ substantive allegations or the relief that claimants seek.Behrens et al. v.

On June 6, 2019, 247 plaintiffs comprised of survivors and estates of decedents of the Grenfell Tower fire filed a complaint against “Arconic Inc., Alcoa Inc. and Arconic Architectural Products, LLC” (collectively, for purposes of the description of such proceeding, the “Arconic Defendants”), as well as Saint-Gobain Corporation, d/b/a Celotex, and Whirlpool Corporation alleging claims under Pennsylvania state law for products liability and wrongful death related to the fire. In particular, the plaintiffs allege that the Arconic Defendants knowingly supplied a dangerous product (""Reynobond PE"") for installation on the Grenfell Tower despite knowing that Reynobond PE was unfit for use above a certain height. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages exceeding $75,000 for each plaintiff. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Defendants moved to dismiss the case on numerous grounds, including forum non conveniens. Defendant Saint-Gobain Corporation was subsequently voluntarily dismissed from the case. On September 16, 2020, the court issued an order granting the remaining defendants’ motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds, subject to certain conditions, determining that the United Kingdom, and not the United States, is the appropriate place for plaintiffs to bring their case. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied on November 23, 2020. Plaintiffs are appealing the judgment; the Arconic Defendants are cross-appealing one of the conditions.  Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al. A purported class action complaint related to the Grenfell Tower fire was filed on August 11, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Arconic Inc. and Klaus Kleinfeld. A related purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on September 15, 2017, under the caption Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al., against Arconic Inc., three former Arconic Inc. executives, several current and former directors, and certain banks. Howard and Sullivan were subsequently consolidated and the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated purported class action filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging violations of the federal securities laws and seeking, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. After the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss in full, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, and all defendants have moved to dismiss the second amended complaint.  Raul v. Albaugh, et al. On June 22, 2018, a derivative complaint was filed nominally on behalf of Arconic Inc. by a purported Arconic Inc. stockholder against the then members of Arconic Inc.’s Board of Directors and Klaus Kleinfeld and Ken Giacobbe, naming Arconic Inc. as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint raises similar allegations as the consolidated amended complaint and second amended complaint in Howard, as well as allegations that the defendants improperly authorized the sale of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses, and asserts claims under federal securities laws and Delaware state law. The case has been stayed until the final resolution of the Howard case, the Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry in London, and the investigation by the Police.  While there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters, Arconic Corporation has agreed to assume and indemnify the Company against potential liabilities associated with them. Stockholder Demands. Prior to the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, the Board of Directors also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of stockholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board authorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board and others. The Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee of the Board to review, investigate, and make recommendations to the Board regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to these stockholder demand letters. On May 22, 2019, the Special Litigation Committee, following completion of its investigation into the claims demanded in the demand letters, recommended to the Board that it reject the demands to authorize commencement of litigation. On May 28, 2019, the Board adopted the Special Litigation Committee’s findings and recommendations and rejected the demands that it authorize commencement of actions to assert the claims set forth in the demand letters.97Table of ContentsLehman Brothers International (Europe) (""LBIE"") Claim. On June 26, 2020, LBIE filed formal proceedings against two Firth Rixson entities (""Firth"") in the High Court of Justice, Business and Property Courts of England and Wales. The proceedings relate to interest rate swap transactions that Firth entered into with LBIE in 2007 to 2008. In 2008, LBIE commenced insolvency proceedings, an event of default under the agreements, rendering LBIE unable to meet its obligations under the swaps and suspending Firth’s payment obligations. In the Court proceedings, LBIE seeks a declaration that Firth has a contractual obligation to pay the amounts owing to LBIE under the agreements. The parties filed position papers on July 24, 2020 and October 19, 2020 (LBIE) and September 21, 2020 (Firth). A virtual hearing in this matter occurred on January 13 and 14, 2021 in London. A decision is expected in three to six months. The resolution of this matter is not probable as of December 31, 2020.Other. In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, tax and antitrust matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.CommitmentsPurchase Obligations. Howmet has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, energy and other goods and services, which total $210 in 2021, $31 in 2022, $10 in 2023, $8 in 2024, $0 in 2025, and $0 thereafter.Operating Leases. See Note Q for the operating lease future minimum contractual obligations.Guarantees. At December 31, 2020, Howmet had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2021 and 2040 was $44 at December 31, 2020.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Howmet and Alcoa Corporation, Howmet was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a fair value of $12 and $9 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company was required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,398 and $1,353 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. For this guarantee, subject to its provisions, the Company is secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation. The Company currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote.Letters of Credit. The Company has outstanding letters of credit, primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2021, was $105 at December 31, 2020.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreements between the Company and Arconic Corporation and between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is required to retain letters of credit of $53 that had previously been provided related to the Company, Arconic Corporation, and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of April 1, 2020 and November 1, 2016. Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation and letters of credit fees paid by the Company are being proportionally billed to and are being reimbursed by Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation, respectively. Also, the Company was required to provide letters of credit for certain Arconic Corporation environmental obligations and, as a result, the Company has $29 of outstanding letters of credit relating to liabilities (which are included in the $105 in the above paragraph). $13 of these outstanding letters of credit are pending cancellation and will be deemed cancelled once returned by the beneficiary. Arconic Corporation has issued surety bonds to cover these environmental obligations. Arconic Corporation is being billed for these letter of credit fees paid by the Company and will reimburse the Company for any payments made under these letters of credit.Surety Bonds. The Company has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these surety bonds, which expire and automatically renew at various dates, primarily in 2021, was $43 at December 31, 2020.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreements between the Company and Arconic Corporation and between the Company and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is required to provide surety bonds of $26 (which are included in the $43 in the above paragraph) that had previously been provided related to the Company, Arconic Corporation, and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to the respective separation transactions of April 1, 2020 and November 1, 98Table of Contents2016. Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims paid and surety bond fees paid by the Company are being proportionately billed to and are being reimbursed by Arconic Corporation and Alcoa Corporation.W.

6,,">Item 1A. Risk Factors. Arconic’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing Arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Arconic or that Arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company in future periods.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe markets for Arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.Arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation and building and construction industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control.In particular, Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators, the retirement of older aircraft, the performance and cost of alternative materials, and technological improvements to aircraft. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older military aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines.Further, the demand for Arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive and commercial transportation manufacturers and volume of aluminum content per vehicle. The automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions, including credit markets and interest rates, and consumer spending and 15Table of Contentspreferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage, vehicle size, configuration and features. Automotive and commercial transportation sales and production can also be affected by other factors, including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and levels of competition both within and outside of the aluminum industry.Arconic is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government actions. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.As discussed in Part I, Item 1. (Business-Competitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for Arconic’s products are highly competitive. Arconic’s competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. New product offerings, new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace Arconic products. The willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Arconic, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for Arconic’s products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Arconic’s competitors or customers could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, Arconic may face increased competition due to industry consolidation. As companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or merged. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of Arconic’s business may acquire or form alliances with Arconic’s competitors, thereby reducing their business with Arconic. Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. Consolidation within Arconic’s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect Arconic’s profitability. Moreover, if, as a result of increased leverage, customers require Arconic to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished, Arconic could decide not to sell certain products to a particular customer, or not to sell certain products at all, which would decrease Arconic’s revenue. Consolidation within Arconic’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for Arconic’s products, a combined entity replacing Arconic’s products with those of Arconic’s competitors and cancellations of orders. The result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, operating results and financial condition.Arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers.Arconic has long-term contracts with a significant number of its customers, some of which are subject to renewal, renegotiation or re-pricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions. Arconic’s failure to successfully renew, renegotiate or favorably re-price such agreements, or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships, could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue.Additionally, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by Arconic could affect Arconic’s financial results. Arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their businesses. For example, in 2019, Boeing announced a temporary reduction in the production rate of, and subsequently announced a temporary suspension of production of, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, a reduction in sales of aluminum sheet and plate and other products that Arconic produces for Boeing airplanes. As no firm timeline has been established for either the adjustment of Boeing’s manufacturing plans, or for returning the aircraft into service, we are currently unable to definitively quantify any such potential impact.Arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Arconic, including to reduce the amount of Arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers. If Arconic’s customers reduce, terminate or delay purchases from Arconic due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and Arconic is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.Arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety, which could affect Arconic’s reputation, business and financial statements.The manufacture of many of Arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols, specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, problems with raw materials, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, labor unrest and environmental factors. Such problems could have an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product quality or on performance. Product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure. Because of approval, license and qualification 16Table of Contentsrequirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to Arconic or its customers. Accordingly, manufacturing problems, product defects or other risks associated with our products, could result in significant costs to and liability for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages, fines or penalties, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Arconic’s business depends, in part, on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations, reductions and delays.Arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation, military aircraft and aircraft engine programs as well as aluminum sheet and extrusions for a number of aluminum-intensive automotive vehicle programs. Many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years. If Arconic fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, program cancellations, reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business.Product liability, product safety, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims and investigations may materially affect Arconic’s financial condition and damage Arconic’s reputation. The manufacture and sale of our products exposes Arconic to potential product liability, personal injury, property damage and related claims. These claims may arise from failure to meet product specifications, design flaws in our products, malfunction of our products, misuse of our products, use of our products in an unintended, unapproved or unrecommended manner, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us. New data and information, including information about the ways in which Arconic’s products are used, may lead Arconic, regulatory authorities, government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations, or impose restrictions, related to the manufacturing or use of Arconic’s products. In the event that an Arconic product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, Arconic may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. In addition, if an Arconic product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, sales of Arconic’s products could be diminished, Arconic’s reputation could be adversely impacted and Arconic could be subject to further liability claims. Moreover, events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose Arconic to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that Arconic will be successful in defending any such proceedings or that insurance available to Arconic will be sufficient to cover any losses associated with such proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could: (i) have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or profitability; (ii) impose substantial monetary damages and/or non-monetary penalties; (iii) result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations or other proceedings involving Arconic; result in loss of customers; (iv) require changes to our products or business operations; or (v) damage Arconic’s reputation and/or negatively impact the market price of Arconic’s common stock. Even if Arconic successfully defends against these types of claims, Arconic could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims; Arconic’s management could be required to devote significant time, attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims and responding to these investigations; and Arconic’s reputation could suffer. Product liability claims and related lawsuits and investigations, product recalls, and allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. For further discussion of potential liability associated with some of our products, including proceedings and investigations relating to the June 13, 2017 fire at the Grenfell Tower in London, U.K., see Part I, Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report. Arconic’s global operations expose Arconic to risks that could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the market price of its securities.Arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, China, Japan and Russia. As a result, Arconic’s global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which Arconic does business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, including:•economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers (including tariffs imposed by the United States as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China or other foreign entities), taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of assets or earnings;17Table of Contents•geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements;•war or terrorist activities;•kidnapping of personnel;•major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, coronavirus (including the novel strain that surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which has resulted in travel restrictions and shutdown of certain businesses in the region), or the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Arconic’s operations, workforce or supply chain;•difficulties enforcing contractual rights and intellectual property, including a lack of remedies for misappropriation in certain jurisdictions; •changes in trade and tax laws that may result in our customers being subjected to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and reduce their willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products;•rising labor costs;•labor unrest, including strikes;•compliance with antitrust and competition regulations; •compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. laws;•aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by national governmental authorities;•compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and corruption laws;•compliance with U.S. laws concerning trade, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control; •imposition of currency controls; and•adverse tax audit rulings,Although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company’s international operations subject Arconic to complex and dynamic laws and regulations that, in some cases, could result in conflict or inconsistency between applicable laws and/or legal obligations. While Arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management, compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the associated risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs, penalties, liabilities or other potential risks such as loss of export privileges or repatriation of assets that may arise from such events.A material disruption of Arconic’s operations, particularly at one or more of the Company’s manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect Arconic’s business.If Arconic’s operations, particularly one of the Company’s manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, theft, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes or other reasons, Arconic may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers, which could adversely affect Arconic’s financial performance.Interruptions in production could increase Arconic’s costs and reduce its sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to incur costs for premium freight, make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect Arconic’s profitability and financial condition. Furthermore, because customers may be dependent on planned deliveries from us, customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our delivery delays may be able to pursue financial claims against us, and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims. Arconic maintains property damage insurance that the Company believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under Arconic’s insurance policies may not offset the lost profits or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect Arconic’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.18Table of ContentsArconic may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business segments, or complete projects, at the levels, projected costs or by the dates targeted.From time to time, Arconic may announce future targets or goals for its business, which are based on the Company’s then current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which Arconic operates. Future targets and goals reflect the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends, then current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. As such, targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. The actual outcome may be materially different. There can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the Company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all. Failure to achieve the targets or goals by the Company may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.In addition, the implementation of Arconic’s business strategy periodically involves the entry into and the execution of complex projects, which place significant demands on the Company’s management and personnel, and may depend on numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. There can be no assurance that such projects will be completed within budgeted costs, on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to the risks described in this report, or other factors. The failure to complete a material project as planned, or a significant delay in a material project, whatever the cause, could have an adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.Information technology system failures, cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Arconic’s intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Arconic relies on its information technology systems to manage and operate its business, process transactions, and summarize its operating results. Arconic’s information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by employees. If Arconic’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and Arconic may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material disruption in the Company’s information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic also faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches.The Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Arconic’s financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Arconic employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks, including technical security controls, data encryption, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, anti-virus software and frequent backups. Additionally, the Company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and could result in the diminution of the value of the Company’s investment in research and development.Arconic’s enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from cyber attacks and security breaches. Arconic also maintains compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber attack or security breach. 19Table of ContentsHowever, a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around the Company’s cybersecurity environment may prevent Arconic from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or the market price of its securities.Arconic may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully.Arconic’s competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to:•identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in Arconic’s target end-markets;•identify and successfully execute on a strategy to remain an essential and sustainable element of its customers’ supply chains; •fund, develop, manufacture and bring innovative new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively;•monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers’ and competitors’ abilities to deploy those disruptive technologies; and•achieve sufficient return on investment for new products based on capital expenditures and research and development spending.Arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects, including advanced alloy development, engineered finishes and product design, rolling technology, and other advanced manufacturing technologies.  While Arconic intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors, including those developing technology to displace Arconic’s current products. In addition, Arconic may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages. There can be no assurance that any of Arconic’s new products or services, development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or beneficial to Arconic.Arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending.Arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft and armored vehicles. Although many of the programs in which Arconic participates extend several years, they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations. Changes in military strategy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for Arconic’s products, which could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business and competitive position.Arconic owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining Arconic’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Arconic’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Arconic’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents Arconic owns or licenses. Despite its controls and safeguards, Arconic’s technology may be misappropriated by its employees, its competitors or other third parties. The pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of Arconic intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. Further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of Arconic intellectual property increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against Arconic relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce Arconic’s rights sufficiently, could adversely affect Arconic’s business and competitive position.A decline in Arconic’s financial performance or outlook or a deterioration in its credit profile could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital markets, reduce its liquidity and increase its borrowing costs.Arconic has significant capital requirements and depends, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic acquisitions. A decline in the Company’s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors could affect the Company’s access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that Arconic will have access to the global capital market on terms the Company finds acceptable. Limitations on Arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in the Company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.A downgrade of Arconic’s credit ratings could limit Arconic’s ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of its securities, 20Table of Contentstrigger letter of credit or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.Arconic’s credit ratings are important to the Company’s cost of capital. The major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations, execution and timeliness of financial reporting. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings Arconic receives impact our borrowing costs as well as the terms upon which we will have access to capital. Failure to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position, and could also restrict our access to capital markets.On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3.  On February 7, 2019, S&P placed the rating on negative credit watch and, subsequently, on April 26, S&P affirmed the long-term debt rating at BBB- but changed the outlook to negative.  On January 28, 2020, S&P affirmed the long-term debt rating at BBB- but changed the outlook to stable in expectation of the Separation impact.  On November 1, 2016, Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) downgraded Arconic’s long-term debt rating from Ba1, a non-investment grade, to Ba2 with a stable outlook and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade Liquidity-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2.  Moody’s ratings and outlooks were affirmed on November 2, 2017, October 8, 2018, and October 9, 2019.  On January 24, 2020, Moody’s affirmed the long-term debt rating at Ba2 but changed the outlook to negative.  On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the outlook from evolving to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on July 3, 2017). On September 27, 2018, Fitch changed the outlook from stable to positive (ratings and outlook were affirmed on October 8, 2019).There can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to Arconic’s ratings in the future. Increased debt levels, macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Company’s debt protection metrics, a contraction in the Company’s liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.A downgrade of Arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could: (i) result in adverse consequences, including: adversely impact the market price of Arconic’s securities; (ii) adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by S&P or Moody’s would subject Arconic to higher costs under Arconic’s Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities); (iii) limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; (iv) result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs; (v) increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities; or (vi) result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Arconic.Limitations on Arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in Arconic’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.Arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.Arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Arconic’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Arconic’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Company’s position in relation to its competitors.An adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect Arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.Arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. Arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and 21Table of Contentsliabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity. For a discussion regarding how Arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7. (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Arconic would contribute to the pension plans.Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) was signed into law. HATFA extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law. BBA 2015 extends the relief period provided by HATFA. Arconic believes that the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Company’s U.S. pension plans’ funded status over the next several years due to recent and potential future declines in discount rates. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Company’s cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Company’s liabilities related to such plans, which could adversely affect Arconic’s liquidity and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in Arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Arconic’s future profitability.Arconic is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Company’s tax expense and profitability. Arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.Corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. In particular, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) was signed into law, significantly reforming the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 Act. Those guidance projects, which include both Proposed and Final Treasury Regulations, continued in 2019 and may continue in 2020. Arconic continues to review the components of the 2017 Act, as well as the ongoing interpretive guidance, and evaluate its consequences. As such, the ultimate impact of the 2017 Act may differ from reported amounts due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made to date; and actions the Company may take as a result of the 2017 Act and related guidance. These changes to the U.S. corporate tax system could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on Arconic’s future effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.Arconic may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic alliances.Arconic has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio. There is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company, unanticipated costs and liabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. The Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. Additionally, adverse factors may prevent Arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines.With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, Arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from customers, suppliers, unions, local or 22Table of Contentsnational governments, or other stakeholders. In addition, Arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities or businesses, including, but not limited to, if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Arconic’s business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures.In addition, Arconic has participated in, and may continue to participate in, joint ventures, strategic alliances and other similar arrangements from time to time. Although the Company has, in connection with past and existing joint ventures, sought to protect its interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not Arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may:•have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Company;•exercise veto rights to block actions that Arconic believes to be in our or the joint venture’s or strategic alliance’s best interests; •take action contrary to Arconic’s policies or objectives with respect to investments; or•as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.There can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures, closures, joint ventures, strategic alliances or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to Arconic, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other factors.Arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum.Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminum-based products. The price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable. Although the Company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass substantially all the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the Company’s customers or is otherwise hedged, there are situations where Arconic is unable to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there is a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the Company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers and/or there are other timing factors that may result in Arconic's exposure to certain price fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, since metal prices fluctuate among the various exchanges, Arconic competitors may enjoy a metal price advantage from time to time.Arconic may be adversely affected by changes in the availability or cost of other raw materials (including, but not limited to, cobalt, nickel, titanium sponge, vanadium, copper, magnesium and zinc), as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions, changes in world politics or regulatory requirements (such as human rights regulations or environmental regulations), labor relations between the producers and their work forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, sanctions, new or increased import duties, countervailing or anti-dumping duties, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. In addition, from time to time, commodity prices may fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve, which may cause periodic supply interruptions. Arconic may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s operating results.Arconic is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial portion of our aluminum and certain other raw materials essential to our operations. Arconic has supply arrangements with a limited number of suppliers for aluminum and other raw materials. We maintain annual or long-term contracts for a majority of our supply requirements, and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases. From time to time, increasing demand levels have caused regional supply constraints in the industry and further increases in demand levels could exacerbate these issues. Such constraints could impact our production or force us to purchase primary metal and other supplies from alternative sources, which may not be available in sufficient quantities or may only be available on terms that are less favorable to us. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, or obtain replacements for, any of our long-term contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements or at all. Additionally, Arconic could have exposure if a key supplier in a particular region is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis. In addition, a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of our significant suppliers exposes us to the risk of default by the supplier on our contractual agreements, and this risk is increased by weak and deteriorating economic conditions on a global, regional or industry sector level. 23Table of ContentsArconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, economic factors, and currency controls in the countries in which it operates.Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which Arconic operates, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect Arconic’s revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, including the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan (renminbi), Japanese yen and Russian ruble, may affect Arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while the Company’s products are generally sold in U.S. dollars.In addition, a portion of Arconic’s indebtedness, including certain borrowings under the Company’s Five-Year Credit Facility, bears interest at rates equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Accordingly, the Company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. Further, LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include changes in the cost of Arconic’s variable rate indebtedness.Arconic also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the Company’s ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by Arconic’s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. While Arconic currently has no need, and does not intend, to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, should the Company need to do so to fund its operations, it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs. Arconic currently has substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including China, and, if the Company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on Arconic’s operating results and financial condition.Arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.Arconic has undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including deployment of company-wide business process models, such as Arconic’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and operating cost reductions. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to Arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. If Arconic fails to achieve net cost savings at anticipated levels, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.Arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials.Certain applications of Arconic’s aluminum-based products compete with products made from other materials, such as steel, titanium and composites. The willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum often depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes. For example, the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum, such as titanium and composites, in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft. Additionally, the automotive industry, while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum, may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications. Further, the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices or compatibility of aluminum with other materials used by a customer in a given application. The willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of Arconic’s products, and thus adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Labor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.A significant portion of Arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see “Employees” in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report. While Arconic previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions, Arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Arconic’s facilities in the future. Arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.24Table of ContentsA failure to attract, retain or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect Arconic’s operations and competitiveness.Arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience. The inability of the Company to attract and retain such people may adversely impact Arconic’s ability to meet project demands adequately and fill roles in existing operations. Skills shortages in engineering, manufacturing, technology, construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities. These shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations.In addition, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the Company’s growth and business strategy. The loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm Arconic’s business, and any unplanned turnover, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions, could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base, result in loss of technical or other expertise, delay or impede the execution of the Company’s business plans and erode Arconic’s competitiveness.Arconic may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.Arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Arconic. The Company may experience an unfavorable change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. Arconic is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks in the United States and abroad in connection with its business and products. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, product testing, health and safety, environmental matters, employment matters, required record keeping and record retention, compliance with securities laws, intellectual property rights, government contracts and taxes, insurance or commercial matters, as well as compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing import and export, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, sales and trading practices, human rights and modern slavery, sourcing of raw materials, third-party relationships, supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products. Arconic may be a party to litigation in a foreign jurisdiction where geopolitical risks might influence the ultimate outcome of such litigation. Arconic could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.The global and diverse nature of Arconic’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. While Arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. Litigation and compliance efforts may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, including proceedings and investigations relating to the June 13, 2017 fire at the Grenfell Tower in London, U.K., see the discussion in Part I, Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).Arconic is exposed to environmental and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities.Arconic’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including present, past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates, at sites that it may acquire in the future, or at third-party sites used by Arconic, its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including remediation obligations, may prove to be 25Table of Contentsmore challenging and costly than the Company anticipates. Arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, including increased remediation costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, the industrial activities conducted at Arconic’s facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees, customers or third parties that may be on site. We have experienced serious injuries in the past, notwithstanding the safety protocols, practices and precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies in the United States and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. From time to time, we have incurred fines for violations of various health and safety standards. While we maintain insurance and have in place policies to minimize such risks, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any injury or death that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity and/or significant reputational harm.Arconic is subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business results.Arconic is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), state and local wage laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and regulations related to safety, discrimination, organizing, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments, citizenship requirements, and healthcare insurance mandates. Allegations that Arconic has violated such laws or regulations could damage the Company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which could have a material adverse impact on Arconic’s operations and financial condition.Arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.Increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems, additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards in the United States. New or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect Arconic and its customers and suppliers, including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company or its customers or suppliers. Also, Arconic relies on natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities. Any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the Company and its customers and suppliers, which could also have a negative impact on Arconic’s profitability.Changes in the United Kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect Arconic.In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally triggered the process to withdraw from the European Union (also referred to as ""Brexit"") following the results of a national referendum that took place in June 2016. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period through December 31, 2020 has been established to allow the United Kingdom and the European Union to negotiate the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal. However, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including trade agreements between the United Kingdom and the European Union.The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic are difficult to predict, but because the Company currently operates and conducts business in the United Kingdom and in Europe, Brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to Arconic’s businesses, 26Table of Contentsincluding affecting the business of and/or our relationships with Arconic’s customers and suppliers, as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies, including the value of the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect Arconic’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the United Kingdom and the European Union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during the transition period or more permanently.Dividends on Arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances.Arconic has historically paid dividends on its common stock; however, it has no obligation to do so. The existence, timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to Arconic’s stockholders falls within the discretion of Arconic’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s dividend policy may change at any time without advance notice to Arconic’s stockholders. For example, on February 8, 2019, in connection with the Company’s ongoing strategic and portfolio review, Arconic announced that it expected to reduce its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. The Arconic Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Arconic’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Company’s debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that Arconic’s Board of Directors deems relevant. Arconic’s Board of Directors may determine to further reduce or eliminate Arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions or in other circumstances.Anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Arconic, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of Arconic’s shareholders.Arconic’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Arconic’s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Arconic is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Arconic. Additionally, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes Arconic’s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other anti-takeover measures without shareholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Arconic’s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Arconic common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.Risks Related to the Separation of AlcoaThe Separation of Alcoa could result in substantial tax liability.It was a condition to the Distribution of Alcoa that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation of Alcoa and the Distribution of Alcoa received by Arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to Arconic’s Board of Directors and (ii) Arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the Distribution of Alcoa. However, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Arconic or Alcoa Corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation of Alcoa-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding Arconic’s receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution of Alcoa and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the 27Table of Contentsconclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Arconic of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution of Alcoa and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Arconic, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic shareholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.If the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Arconic shareholders who received Alcoa Corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.Under current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution of Alcoa may nevertheless be rendered taxable to Arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain post-Distribution of Alcoa transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of Arconic or Alcoa Corporation. The possibility of rendering the Distribution of Alcoa taxable as a result of such transactions may limit Arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of Arconic’s business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation may be required to indemnify Arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of Alcoa Corporation stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing actively to conduct certain of its businesses, (v) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa Corporation or (vi) any of Alcoa Corporation’s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation of Alcoa-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable, Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, Arconic and Arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation of Alcoa, including tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect Arconic’s business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to the Separation of ArconicThe Separation of Arconic involves significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect Arconic’s business, may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits, is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timelines, or at all.On February 8, 2019, Arconic announced plans to separate into two independent, publicly-traded companies, composed of the Engineered Products and Forgings businesses, on the one hand, and the Global Rolled Products businesses, on the other hand.  The Separation of Arconic will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, receipt of a tax opinion from external counsel.Arconic expects that the process of completing the Separation of Arconic will be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what it currently anticipates and may not yield a benefit if the Separation of Arconic is not completed. Executing the Separation of Arconic will also require significant time and attention from Arconic’s senior management and employees, which could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and adversely affect financial results and results of operations. Arconic may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees or maintaining or initiating relationships with lead suppliers, customers and other parties with which Arconic currently does business, or may do business in the future, during the pendency of the Separation of Arconic and following its completion, which could have a material and adverse effect on Arconic’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the independent companies resulting from the Separation of Arconic. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that Separation of Arconic will so qualify. If the Separation of Arconic were ultimately determined to be taxable, we, the Company’s shareholders and/or the new independent company would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant.Arconic may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the Separation of Arconic. For example, as independent companies, the Engineered Products & Forgings and Global Rolled Products businesses will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, such as changes in industry conditions, which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows, working capital 28Table of Contentsand financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, following the Separation of Arconic, there can be no assurance that either company will be able to obtain an investment grade rating from nationally recognized credit rating agencies, which could, among other things, increase the non-investment grade rated company’s cost of capital. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of Arconic’s common stock would have been had the proposed Separation of Arconic not occurred. Additionally, the separation is subject to market, regulatory and certain other conditions. Unanticipated developments, including, among others, failure of the Separation of Arconic to qualify for the expected tax treatment, the possibility that any third-party consents required in connection with the Separation of Arconic will not be received, material adverse changes in business or industry conditions and changes in global economic and financial market conditions generally, could delay or prevent the completion of the Separation of Arconic, or cause the Separation of Arconic to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected.",>Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.,">Item 2. Properties.Arconic’s principal office and corporate center is located at 201 Isabella Street, Suite 200, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. The Arconic Technology Center for research and development is located at 100 Technical Drive, New Kensington, Pennsylvania 15069-0001.Arconic leases some of its facilities; however, it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or the properties’ values.Arconic believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of properties owned by Arconic has been made for the purpose of this report, the Company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties. See Notes A and M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Arconic has active plants and holdings under the following segments and in the following geographic areas:ENGINEERED PRODUCTS AND FORGINGSSee the table and related text in the Engineered Products and Forgings Facilities section on page 7 of this report.GLOBAL ROLLED PRODUCTSSee the table and related text in the Global Rolled Products Facilities section on page 10 of this report.",">Item 3. Legal Proceedings.In the ordinary course of its business, Arconic is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential.Environmental MattersArconic is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA) or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The Company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites. The most significant of these matters, the remediation of the Grasse River in Massena, NY, is discussed in the Environmental Matters section of Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental Matters”.Reynobond PEAs previously reported, on June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, U.K. caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic, Arconic Architectural Products SAS (AAP SAS), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metropolitan Police Service (the “Police”), a Public Inquiry by the British government and a 29Table of Contentsconsumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. The Public Inquiry was announced by the U.K. Prime Minister on June 15, 2017 and subsequently was authorized to examine the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire in order to make findings of fact and recommendations to the U.K. Government on matters such as the design, construction, and modification of the building, the role of relevant public authorities and contractors, the implications of the fire for the adequacy and enforcement of relevant regulations, arrangements in place for handling emergencies, and the handling of concerns from residents, among other things. Hearings for Phase 1 of the Public Inquiry began on May 21, 2018 and concluded on December 12, 2018. Phase 2 hearings of the Public Inquiry began in early 2020, following which a final report will be written and subsequently published. AAP SAS is participating as a Core Participant in the Public Inquiry and is also cooperating with the ongoing parallel investigation by the Police. The Company no longer sells the PE product for architectural use on buildings. Given the preliminary nature of these investigations and the uncertainty of potential future litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. Behrens et al. v. Arconic Inc. et al.   As previously reported, on June 6, 2019, 247 plaintiffs comprised of survivors and estates of decedents of the Grenfell Tower fire filed a complaint against “Arconic Inc., Alcoa Inc., and Arconic Architectural Products, LLC” (collectively, for purposes of the description of such proceeding, the “Arconic Defendants”), as well as Saint-Gobain Corporation, d/b/a Celotex and Whirlpool Corporation, in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The complaint alleges claims under Pennsylvania state law for products liability and wrongful death related to the fire. In particular, the plaintiffs allege that the Arconic Defendants knowingly supplied a dangerous product (Reynobond PE) for installation on the Grenfell Tower despite knowing that Reynobond PE was unfit for use above a certain height. The Arconic Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on June 19, 2019. On August 29, 2019, the Arconic Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the bases, among other things, that: (i) the case should be heard in the United Kingdom, not the United States; (ii) there is no jurisdiction over necessary parties; and (iii) Pennsylvania products liability law does not apply to manufacture and sale of product overseas. On December 23, 2019, the Court issued an order denying the motion to dismiss the complaint on bases (ii) and (iii) and suggesting a procedure for limited discovery followed by further briefing on those subjects. Discovery is ongoing on defendants’ motion to have the case dismissed in favor of a UK forum (forum non conveniens). On January 23, 2020, the Court ordered that the parties complete discovery relating to forum non conveniens by March 16, 2020, and that briefing conclude on April 13, 2020. The Court will hold oral argument on this motion on May 7, 2020. Given the preliminary nature of this matter and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al.   As previously reported, a purported class action complaint related to the Grenfell Tower fire was filed on August 11, 2017, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Arconic Inc. and Klaus Kleinfeld. A related purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on September 15, 2017, under the caption Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al., against Arconic Inc. three former Arconic executives, several current and former Arconic directors, and banks that acted as underwriters for Arconic’s September 18, 2014 preferred stock offering (the “Preferred Offering”). The plaintiff in Sullivan had previously filed a purported class action against the same defendants on July 18, 2017 in the Southern District of New York and, on August 25, 2017, voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice. On February 7, 2018, on motion from certain putative class members, the court consolidated Howard and Sullivan, closed Sullivan, and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case. On April 9, 2018, the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated purported class action filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleged that the registration statement for the Preferred Offering contained false and misleading statements and omitted to state material information, including by allegedly failing to disclose material uncertainties and trends resulting from sales of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses and by allegedly expressing a belief that appropriate risk management and compliance programs had been adopted while concealing the risks posed by Reynobond PE sales. The consolidated amended complaint also alleged that between November 4, 2013 and June 23, 2017 Arconic and Kleinfeld made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information about the Company’s commitment to safety, business and financial prospects, and the risks of the Reynobond PE product, including in Arconic’s Form 10-Ks for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, its Form 10-Qs and quarterly financial press releases from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2017, its 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Annual Reports, its 2016 Annual Highlights Report, and on its official website. The consolidated amended complaint sought, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On June 8, 2018, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint for failure to state a claim. On June 21, 2019, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss in full, dismissing the consolidated amended complaint in its entirety without prejudice. On July 23, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint alleges generally the same claims as the consolidated amended complaint with certain additional allegations, as well as claims that the risk factors set forth in the registration statement for the Preferred Offering were inadequate and that certain additional statements in the sources identified above were misleading. The second amended complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On September 11, 2019, all defendants moved to dismiss the second amended 30Table of Contentscomplaint. Plaintiffs’ opposition to that motion was filed on November 1, 2019 and all defendants filed a reply brief on November 26, 2019. Given the preliminary nature of this matter and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. Raul v. Albaugh, et al.   As previously reported, on June 22, 2018, a derivative complaint was filed nominally on behalf of Arconic by a purported Arconic stockholder against the then members of Arconic’s Board of Directors and Klaus Kleinfeld and Ken Giacobbe, naming Arconic as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint raises similar allegations as the consolidated amended complaint and second amended complaint in Howard, as well as allegations that the defendants improperly authorized the sale of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses, and asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Delaware state law. On July 13, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to stay this case until the final resolution of the Howard case, the Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry in London, and the investigation by the Police and on July 23, 2018, the Court approved the stay. Given the preliminary nature of this matter and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. While the Company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. Stockholder Demands.   As previously reported, the Board of Directors also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of stockholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board authorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board, and others. The Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee of the Board to review, investigate, and make recommendations to the Board regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to these stockholder demand letters. On May 22, 2019, the Special Litigation Committee, following completion of its investigation into the claims demanded in the demand letters, recommended to the Board that it reject the demands to authorize commencement of litigation. On May 28, 2019, the Board adopted the Special Litigation Committee’s findings and recommendations and rejected the demands that it authorize commencement of actions to assert the claims set forth in the demand letters. Other MattersAs previously reported, Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury as a result of occupational or other exposure to asbestos. Arconic, its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries have numerous insurance policies over many years that provide coverage for asbestos related claims. Arconic has significant insurance coverage and believes that Arconic’s reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations, cash flows, and financial position of the Company.TaxPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation of Alcoa, the Company shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation for, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the Company with respect to, the following matter.As previously reported, in July 2013, following a Spanish corporate income tax audit covering the 2006 through 2009 tax years, an assessment was received mainly disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. Arconic filed another appeal in Spain’s National Court in March 2015 which was denied in July 2018. The National Court’s decision requires the assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years to be reissued to take into account the outcome of the 2003 to 2005 audit which was closed in 2017. The Company estimates the revised assessment to be $172 million (€154 million), including interest.In March 2019, the Supreme Court of Spain accepted the Company’s petition to review the National Court’s decision, and the Company has filed a formal appeal of the assessment. The Supreme Court is reviewing the assessment on its merits and will render a final decision. In the event the Company receives an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court of Spain, a portion of the assessment may be offset with existing net operating losses and tax credits available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement. In the third quarter of 2018, Arconic established an income tax reserve, and an indemnification receivable representing Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of the liability.  As of the end of 2019, the balances of the reserve, including interest, and the receivable are $59 million (€53 million) and $29 million (€26 million), respectively.Additionally, while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit, it is possible that the Company may receive assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013. Any potential assessment for an individual tax year is not expected to be material 31Table of Contentsto the Company’s consolidated operations. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter.Matters Previously Reported – Alcoa CorporationWe have included the matters discussed below in which the Company remains party to proceedings relating to Alcoa Corporation in accordance with SEC regulations. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation of Alcoa, provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Alcoa Corporation for claims subject to indemnification. The Company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it.St. Croix ProceedingsRed Dust Docket Cases, (St. Croix) f/k/a Abednego, Laurie L.A., et al. v. St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C., et al. As previously reported, on January 14, 2010, Arconic was served with a multi-plaintiff action complaint involving several thousand individual persons claiming to be residents of St. Croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from Hurricane Georges or winds blowing material from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (“SCA”) facility on the island of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) since the time of the hurricane. This complaint, Abednego, et al. v. Alcoa, et al. was filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Arconic and SCA to remove the case to federal court, the case has been lodged in the Superior Court. The complaint names as defendants the same entities that were sued in a February 1999 action arising out of the impact of Hurricane Georges on the island and added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property.Also as previously reported, on March 1, 2012, Arconic was served with a separate multi-plaintiff action complaint involving approximately 200 individual persons alleging claims essentially identical to those set forth in the Abednego v. Alcoa complaint. This complaint, Abraham, et al. v. Alcoa, et al., was filed on behalf of plaintiffs previously dismissed in the federal court proceeding involving the original litigation over Hurricane Georges impacts. The matter was originally filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division, on March 30, 2011.Arconic and other defendants in the Abraham and Abednego cases filed or renewed motions to dismiss each case in March 2012 and August 2012 following service of the Abraham complaint on Arconic and remand of the Abednego complaint to Superior Court, respectively. By order dated August 10, 2015, the Superior Court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaints without prejudice to re-file the complaints individually, rather than as a multi-plaintiff filing. The order also preserves the defendants’ grounds for dismissal if new, individual complaints are filed. On July 7, 2017, the Court issued an order and associated memoranda on plaintiff’s multiple motions for extension of time to file the individual Complaints. Following the court’s July 7, 2017 order, a total of 429 complaints were filed and accepted by the court by the deadline of July 30, 2017 (and consolidated into the Red Dust Claims docket (Master Case No.: SX-15-CV-620)). These complaints include claims of about 1,260 individual plaintiffs.On November 5, 2018, notice of an order of reassignment was entered, transferring the claims to the newly created Complex Litigation Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. On January 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking for a determination that expert testimony will not be required on the issue of causation, which defendants opposed. The Court has not ruled on that motion. Other ContingenciesIn addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, tax and antitrust matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company.",>Item 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the Separation of Alcoa Corporation from the Company, the Company’s common stock traded under the symbol “AA.” In connection with the Separation of Alcoa, on November 1, 2016, the Company changed its stock symbol and its common stock began trading under the symbol “ARNC.”On October 5, 2016, the Company’s common shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding and authorized shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares, and proportionately decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1.8 billion to 0.6 billion shares. The Company’s common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on October 6, 2016.On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the Separation of Alcoa. The Separation of Alcoa was effected by means of a pro rata distribution by the Company of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Company’s shareholders. The Company’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company retained 19.9% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Separation of Alcoa. See disposition of retained shares in Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.In conjunction with the Separation of Arconic, the Company will remain publicly traded and will change its name to “Howmet Aerospace Inc.” (“Howmet Aerospace”) and its stock symbol from “ARNC” to “HWM”, and “Arconic Rolled Products Corporation” will change its name to “Arconic Corporation” and its common stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ARNC.”The number of holders of record of common stock was approximately 10,874 as of February 21, 2020.Stock Performance GraphThe following graph compares the most recent five-year performance of the Company’s common stock with (1) the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500® Index, (2) the S&P 500® Industrials Index, a group of 70 companies categorized by Standard & Poor’s as active in the “industrials” market sector, and (3) the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index, a group of 32 companies categorized by Standard & Poor’s as active in the “aerospace & defense” industry.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts; shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt])OverviewOur BusinessArconic Inc. (“Arconic” or the “Company”) is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, industrial applications, defense, and packaging. Arconic is a global company operating in 18 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 67% and 23%, respectively, of Arconic’s sales in 2019. In addition, Arconic has operating activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in countries with such operating activities.Management Review of 2019 and Outlook for the FutureIn 2019, Sales increased 1% over 2018 as a result of volume growth in the aerospace, packaging, commercial transportation, and industrial end markets; and favorable product pricing in the Global Rolled Products (GRP) and Engineered Products and Forgings (EP&F) segments; partially offset by lower aluminum prices; and lower sales of $216 from divestitures of forgings businesses in the United Kingdom (divested in December 2019) and Eger, Hungary (divested in December 2018), Latin America extrusions (divested in April 2018), and the completed ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations (in December 2018). In the segments, Segment operating profit increased 27% from 2018 due to favorable product pricing, net cost savings, lower raw material costs including aluminum price, and higher volumes, partially offset by the impact of the Tennessee plant transition to industrial production, operational challenges at one aluminum extrusions plant, and higher variable compensation costs.Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has continued its intensified focus on capital efficiency. This focus and the related results enabled Arconic to end 2019 with a solid financial position.The following financial information reflects certain key highlights of Arconic’s 2019 results:•Sales of $14,192, up 1% from 2018, with growth in key end markets, and Net income of $470, or $1.03 per diluted share;•Total segment operating profit of $2,015, an increase of $429, or 27%, from 20181;•Cash provided from operations of $406; cash used for financing activities of $1,568, reflecting the Company’s repurchase of $1,150 of its common stock and the repayment of convertible notes in 2019; and cash provided from investing activities of $583;•Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,648; and•Total debt of $5,940, a decrease of $390 from 2018, reflecting repayment of $403 of convertible notes in October 2019.(1) For the reconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Consolidated income before income taxes and related information, see page 43.The Company rapidly executed on the separation plan that was announced in February 2019 and is targeting completion of the separation on April 1, 2020. The company will separate into two independent, publicly-traded companies, to be named Howmet Aerospace Inc. (Remain Co.) and Arconic Corporation (Spin Co.)  (the “Separation of Arconic”). Remain Co. will be comprised of the Company’s Engineered Products and Forgings businesses (engine products, fastening systems, engineered structures and forged wheels) and will be renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. at separation and change its stock ticker from “ARNC” to “HWM.”  Spin Co. will be comprised of the Company’s Global Rolled Products businesses (global rolled products, aluminum extrusions and building and construction systems) and will be held by a new company that will be named Arconic Corporation at separation and that intends to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ARNC.”  On February 5, 2020, Arconic’s Board of Directors approved the completion of the Separation of Arconic by means of a pro rata distribution by the Company of all of the outstanding common stock of Arconic Corporation, with each Arconic Inc. stockholder of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 receiving one share of Arconic Corporation common stock for every four shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the record date.  On February 7, 2020, the Company announced that Arconic Rolled Products Corporation (the “Issuer”), which is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arconic, 37Table of Contentsclosed its offering of $600 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% second-lien notes due 2028.  The proceeds will be used to make a payment to Arconic to fund the transfer of certain assets to the Issuer in connection with the separation and for general corporate purposes.  On February 13, 2020, the Registration Statement on Form 10 for Arconic Rolled Products Corporation was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.In conjunction with the Separation of Arconic, the Company realigned its reporting segments in the third quarter of 2019 by eliminating its Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and transferring the forged wheels business to the EP&F segment and transferring the building and construction systems business to the GRP segment. The Company also executed on its plan to sell businesses that do not best fit into one of its two segments, having signed or closed on divestitures in 2019 resulting in proceeds of approximately $190.Results of OperationsEarnings SummarySales. Sales for 2019 were $14,192 compared with $14,014 in 2018, an increase of $178, or 1%. The increase was primarily due to volume growth in the aerospace, packaging, commercial transportation, and industrial end markets; favorable product pricing and mix in the GRP segment; and favorable product pricing in the EP&F segment when fulfilling volume above contractual share, renewing contracts, and selling non-contractual spot business; partially offset by lower aluminum prices; lower sales of $216 from the completed ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations (in December 2018) and the divestitures of forgings businesses in the United Kingdom (divested in December 2019) and Hungary (divested in December 2018), and the Latin America extrusions business (divested in April 2018); and unfavorable foreign currency movements.Sales for 2018 were $14,014 compared with $12,960 in 2017, an increase of $1,054, or 8%. The increase was the result of strong volume growth across both segments, primarily in the aerospace engines and defense, automotive, commercial transportation, industrial, and building and construction end markets; higher aluminum prices and favorable product mix primarily in the GRP segment; and favorable foreign currency movements; partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market; lower sales of $190 from the divestitures of the Latin America extrusions business, the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy (divested in March 2017), and the ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations; and costs of $38 in 2018 related to settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). COGS as a percentage of Sales was 79.1% in 2019 compared with 81.3% in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower raw material costs including aluminum prices; net cost savings; favorable product pricing; and costs incurred in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 related to settlements of certain customer claims of $38 noted above and a charge related to a physical inventory adjustment at one plant in the GRP segment of $23. These positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable product mix; a charge for environmental remediation at Grasse River of $25; the impairment of energy business assets of $10; and a charge primarily for a one-time signing bonus for employees associated with the collective bargaining agreement negotiation of $9. In June of 2019 the Company and the United Steelworkers reached a tentative three-year labor agreement covering approximately 3,400 employees at four U.S. locations; the previous labor agreement expired on May 15, 2019. The tentative agreement was ratified on July 11, 2019. Additionally, in 2019, the Company sustained a fire at a fasteners plant in France and recorded charges of $26 for higher operating costs, equipment and inventory damage, and repairs and cleanup costs. The Company submitted an insurance claim and received a partial settlement of $25, which was in excess of its $10 insurance deductible. The insurance claim included $8 of margin not recognized from lost revenue due to the fire. The Company anticipates a charge of approximately $10 to $15 in the first quarter of 2020, with additional impacts in subsequent quarters as the business continues to recover from the fire, which are also expected to be covered by insurance proceeds.COGS as a percentage of Sales was 81.3% in 2018 compared with 78.9% in 2017. The increase was the result of higher aluminum prices; unfavorable aerospace product mix; higher transportation costs; manufacturing inefficiencies in Engineered Structures; performance shortfalls in the Disks asset group; costs related to settlements of certain customer claims noted above; and the impact of a charge related to a physical inventory adjustment at one plant in the GRP segment of $23 that was recorded in the second quarter of 2018. While a portion of this charge for the physical inventory adjustment related to prior years, the majority related to the first half of 2018. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual periods.Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses (SG&A). SG&A expenses were $704, or 5.0% of Sales, in 2019 compared with $604, or 4.3% of Sales, in 2018. The increase in SG&A of $100, or 17%, was primarily due to costs associated with the planned Separation of Arconic of $78 and higher annual incentive compensation accruals and executive compensation costs, partially offset by lower costs driven by overhead cost reductions and lower net legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $10, primarily due to insurance reimbursements.SG&A expenses were $604, or 4.3% of Sales, in 2018 compared with $715, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2017. The decrease in SG&A of $111, or 16%, was the result of proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58, costs related to the Separation of Alcoa Inc. of $18, and costs associated with the Company’s Delaware reincorporation of $3 in 2017, none of which recurred in 2018. 38Table of ContentsAdditionally, lower expenses driven by lower annual incentive compensation accruals and overhead cost reductions were somewhat offset by an increase in legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $4 as well as strategy and portfolio review costs of $7 in 2018.Research and Development Expenses (R&D). R&D expenses were $70 in 2019 compared with $103 in 2018. The decrease of $33, or 32%, was primarily due to the consolidation of the Company's primary R&D facility in conjunction with ongoing cost reduction efforts.R&D expenses were $103 in 2018 compared with $109 in 2017. The decrease of $6, or 6%, was the result of lower spending.Provision for Depreciation and Amortization (D&A). The provision for D&A was $536 in 2019 compared with $576 in 2018. The decrease of $40, or 7%, was primarily due to the impact of divestitures, as well as asset impairments in the EP&F segment during the second quarter of 2019 (see Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K).The provision for D&A was $576 in 2018 compared with $551 in 2017. The increase of $25, or 5%, was primarily due to capital projects placed into service.Impairment of Goodwill. In 2017, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $719 related to the annual impairment review of its Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (AFE) business (see Goodwill under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below).Restructuring and Other Charges. Restructuring and other charges were $620 in 2019 compared with $9 in 2018 and $165 in 2017.Restructuring and other charges in 2019 primarily included asset impairments of $556, related to the Disks asset group of $428, agreements to sell the Company’s Brazilian rolling mill operations, the U.K. forgings business, and a small additive business of $112, and a trade name intangible asset and properties, plant, and equipment related to the Company’s primary research and development facility of $25; and a charge for layoff costs of $103, including the separation of approximately 1,310 employees; partially offset by a benefit from the elimination of the life insurance benefit for the U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries of $58; and a gain for contingent consideration received from the sale of the Texarkana rolling mill of $20.Restructuring and other charges in 2018 primarily included a charge for pension and other postretirement benefits net settlements and curtailments of $91; a loss on the sale of the Hungary forgings business of $43; and a charge for layoff costs of $20, including the separation of approximately 125 employees; partially offset by a gain on the asset sale of the Texarkana rolling mill of $154.Restructuring and other charges in 2017 primarily included a charge for layoff costs of $69, including the separation of approximately 880 employees; a charge related to the sale of the Italy rolling mill of $60; and a charge for the impairment of assets associated with the sale of the Latin America extrusions business of $41.See Note C to the to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Interest Expense. Interest expense was $338 in 2019 compared with $378 in 2018. The decrease of $40, or 11%, was primarily due to lower debt outstanding, driven by the repayment of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 1.63% Convertible Notes of approximately $403 on October 15, 2019, as well as costs incurred of $19 in 2018 related to the premium paid on the early redemption of the Company’s then outstanding 5.72% Senior Notes due 2019 that did not recur in 2019.Interest expense was $378 in 2018 compared with $496 in 2017. The decrease of $118, or 24%, was the result of higher costs incurred in 2017 related to the early redemption of the Company’s outstanding debt than were incurred during 2018, as well as lower debt outstanding.Other Expense (Income), Net. Other expense, net was $122 in 2019 compared with $79 in 2018. The increase of $43 was primarily due to an increase in deferred compensation arrangements and related investment performance and the benefit recognized in 2018 from establishing a tax indemnification receivable reflecting Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of a Spanish tax reserve of $29 that did not recur in 2019, partially offset by favorable foreign currency movements. Other expense, net was $79 in 2018 compared with Other income, net of $486 in 2017. The decrease in Other income, net of $565 was the result of gains recorded during 2017 related to the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock of $351, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange (in April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the “Investment Banks”) in exchange for cash and the Company’s remaining 12,958,767 shares (valued at $35.91 per share) in Alcoa Corporation stock and recorded a gain of $167), income associated with an adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition of $81 (see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), and 39Table of Contentsincome due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee of $25, none of which recurred in 2018, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, somewhat offset by lower non-service related net periodic benefit cost and the benefit of $29 from establishing a tax indemnification receivable reflecting Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of a Spanish tax reserve (see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K).Income Taxes. Arconic’s effective tax rate was 18.3% in 2019 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $94 net benefit related to a U.S. tax election which caused the deemed liquidation of a foreign subsidiary’s assets into its U.S. tax parent, a $24 net benefit associated with the deduction of foreign taxes that were previously claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit, and a $12 net benefit for foreign tax rate changes, partially offset by the tax impact of $89 of non-deductible executive compensation and transaction costs, $53 of impairment charges related to the Company’s Brazilian rolling mill operations and other foreign losses with no tax benefit, a $14 charge for U.S. state taxes, and by foreign income subject to U.S. taxes.Arconic’s effective tax rate was 26.0% in 2018 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $60 charge to establish a tax reserve in Spain, a $59 net charge resulting from the Company’s finalized analysis of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 (""the 2017 Act""), a $13 charge for U.S. state taxes, foreign income taxed in higher rate jurisdictions, and foreign losses with no tax benefit, partially offset by a $74 benefit related to the reversal of a foreign recapture obligation, a $38 benefit to reverse a foreign tax reserve that is effectively settled, and a $10 benefit for the release of U.S. valuation allowances. Arconic’s effective tax rate was 115.7% in 2017 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $719 impairment of goodwill, a $41 impairment of assets in the Latin America extrusions business, and a $60 charge related to the sale of a rolling mill in Italy that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $272 tax charge as a provisional impact of the 2017 Act, and a $23 tax charge for an increase in an uncertain tax position in Germany, partially offset by a $73 tax benefit related to the sale and Debt-for-Equity Exchange of the Alcoa Corporation stock, a $69 tax benefit for the release of U.S. state valuation allowances net of the federal tax benefit, a $27 favorable tax impact associated with a non-taxable earn-out liability adjustment in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition, and by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions. Arconic’s effective tax rate was 356.5% in 2016 compared with the U.S. fedArconic anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 26.5% and 28.5%. However, the planned Separation of Arconic, other business portfolio actions, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stock-based payment awards, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate.Net Income. Net income was $470 for 2019, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to Net income of $642 for 2018, or $1.33 per share. The decrease in results of $172 was primarily due to higher Restructuring and other charges; higher SG&A expenses due to costs associated with the planned Separation of Arconic of $70 ($78 before-tax) and higher annual incentive compensation accruals and executive compensation costs; and higher Other expense, net due to an increase in deferred compensation arrangements and related investment performance and the benefit recognized in 2018 from establishing a tax indemnification receivable reflecting Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of a Spanish tax reserve of $28 ($29 before-tax) that did not recur in 2019; partially offset by volume growth; favorable product pricing; net cost savings; lower D&A due to the impact of divestitures as well as asset impairments in the EP&F segment; lower Interest expense due to lower debt outstanding and costs incurred of $15 ($19 before-tax) in 2018 related to the premium paid on the early redemption of debt that did not recur in 2019; lower R&D expenses due to the consolidation of the Company's primary R&D facility in conjunction with ongoing cost reduction efforts; and lower Income taxes primarily as a result of a benefit related to a U.S. tax election which caused the deemed liquidation of a foreign subsidiary’s assets into its U.S. tax parent.Net income was $642 for 2018, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to a Net loss of $74 for 2017, or $0.28 per share. The increase in results of $716 was due in part to the following items that occurred in 2017 but did not recur in 2018: a charge for goodwill impairment of $719 ($719 pre-tax); gains related to the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and the Debt-for-Equity Exchange of $405 ($518 pre-tax); and favorable adjustments to contingent earn-out and guarantee liabilities of $97 ($106 pre-tax). Additional favorable impacts in 2018 included: volume growth across both segments; lower SG&A expenses due to proxy and separation costs incurred in 2017 and not recurring in 2018, as well as lower incentive compensation accruals; lower Restructuring and other charges driven primarily by the gain on sale of the Texarkana rolling mill, offset by pension settlement charges and the loss on sale of the forgings business in Hungary; lower Interest expense due to lower debt levels; lower pension expenses; and lower Income taxes. These favorable impacts were partially offset by unfavorable aerospace product mix, higher aluminum prices, manufacturing inefficiencies in Engineered Structures, performance shortfalls in the Disks asset group, settlements of certain customer claims, and an unfavorable physical inventory adjustment at one plant.40Table of ContentsSegment InformationArconic’s operations consist of two worldwide reportable segments: Engineered Products and Forgings (EP&F) and Global Rolled Products (GRP). Segment performance under Arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Arconic’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and other charges and Impairment of goodwill. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between segment totals and consolidated Arconic are in Corporate.In the third quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its operations by eliminating its Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS) segment and transferring the Forged Wheels business to its EP&F segment and the Building and Solutions Systems (BCS) business to its GRP segment, consistent with how the Chief Executive Officer is assessing operating performance and allocating capital in conjunction with the planned Separation of Arconic (see Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K). The Latin America extrusions business, which was formerly part of the Company's TCS segment until its sale in April of 2018 (see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), was moved to Corporate. In the first quarter of 2019, management transferred its aluminum extrusions operations from its Engineered Structures business unit within the EP&F segment to the GRP segment, based on synergies with the GRP segment including similar customer base, technologies, and manufacturing capabilities. Prior period financial information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.Arconic produces aerospace engine parts and components, aerospace fastening systems, and aluminum sheet and plate products for Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. The temporary reduction in the production rate of the 737 MAX airplanes that was announced by Boeing in April 2019 did not have a significant impact on the Company's sales or segment operating profit in 2019. In late December 2019, Boeing announced a temporary suspension of production of the 737 MAX airplanes. In 2020, the Company expects a reduction in production rate to have a negative impact on sales of approximately $400 along with a corresponding impact on segment operating profit in the EP&F and GRP segments.Segment operating profit for all reportable segments totaled $2,015 in 2019, $1,586 in 2018, and $1,689 in 2017. The following information provides Sales and Segment operating profit for each reportable segment, as well as certain shipment data for GRP, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Engineered Products and Forgings  2019 2018 2017Third-party sales$7,105 $6,798 $6,300Segment operating profit$1,390 $1,105 $1,119The Engineered Products and Forgings segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (aluminum, titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils; forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks); extruded, machined and forged aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum); and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Approximately 70% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged and machined metal products (titanium and aluminum) for various end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are experienced for certain products in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, British pound and the euro.On December 1, 2019, Arconic completed the divestiture of its forgings business in the United Kingdom. The forgings business primarily produces steel, titanium, and nickel based forged components for aerospace, mining, and off-highway markets. This business generated third-party sales of $116, $131, and $127 in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and had 540 employees at the time of the divestiture.On December 31, 2018, as part of the Company’s then ongoing strategy and portfolio review, Arconic completed the sale of its forgings business in Hungary that manufactured high volume steel forgings for drivetrain components in the European heavy-duty truck and automotive market. This business generated third-party sales of $32 and $38 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and had 180 employees at the time of the divestiture.Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Forgings segment increased $307, or 5%, in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily as a result of higher aerospace and commercial transportation volumes and favorable product pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements and lower sales of $47 from divestitures of forgings businesses in the United Kingdom (divested in December 2019) and Hungary (divested in December 2018).41Table of ContentsThird-party sales for this segment increased $498, or 8%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily attributable to higher volumes in the aerospace engines, defense, and commercial transportation end markets and favorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine market and lower aerospace pricing principally in the fasteners business.Segment operating profit for the Engineered Products and Forgings segment increased $285, or 26%, in 2019 compared with 2018, due to net cost savings, higher volumes as noted previously, favorable product pricing, and lower raw material costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of new product introductions in aerospace engines and unfavorable product mix.Segment operating profit for this segment decreased $14, or 1%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily attributable to performance shortfalls in the Disks asset group; manufacturing inefficiencies in the Engineered Structures business, associated with the now resolved forging press outage at the Cleveland facility that impacted the fourth quarter of 2018 with higher costs of $10; unfavorable aerospace engine mix and new product introductions; and lower aerospace pricing principally in the fasteners business; partly offset by the strength in aerospace engine, defense, and commercial transportation volumes and net cost savings.In 2020 compared to 2019, demand in the commercial aerospace end market, excluding the impact of Boeing 737 MAX, is expected to remain strong, driven by the ramp-up of new aerospace engine platforms. Demand in the defense end market is expected to continue to grow due to the ramp-up of certain aerospace programs, while the commercial transportation end market is expected to be down. Net cost savings and favorable pricing are expected to continue.In mid-February 2020, a fire occurred at the Company’s forged wheels plant located in Barberton, Ohio. While some equipment has safely been returned to service at reduced production levels, the extent of the damage and the financial impact are not yet known as the investigation into the cause of the fire and its full impact continues. The Company has insurance with a deductible of $10.Global Rolled Products 2019 2018 2017Third-party sales$7,082 $7,223 $6,540Intersegment sales183 205 183Total sales$7,265 $7,428 $6,723Segment operating profit$625 $481 $570Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt)1,379 1,301 1,249The Global Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate, aluminum extruded and machined parts, integrated aluminum structural systems, and architectural extrusions used in the automotive, aerospace, building and construction, industrial, packaging, and commercial transportation end markets. Products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro, the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and the British pound.In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its Fusina, Italy rolling mill. The rolling mill generated third-party sales of $54 in 2017 and had approximately 312 employees.Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment decreased $141, or 2%, in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily as a result of lower aluminum prices, the absence of sales of $144 from the completed ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations (completed in December 2018), and unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by favorable product pricing and mix and higher volumes in the packaging, aerospace, and industrial end markets.Third-party sales for this segment increased $683, or 10%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily attributable to higher aluminum prices; higher volumes in the automotive, commercial transportation, and industrial end markets; and favorable product mix; partially offset by the absence of sales of $54 from the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy and the planned ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations.Segment operating profit for the Global Rolled Products segment increased $144, or 30%, in 2019 compared with 2018, due to favorable pricing adjustments on industrial and commercial transportation products; favorable aluminum price impacts; net cost savings; favorable product mix; and the impact of a charge incurred in 2018 related to a physical inventory adjustment at one plant that did not recur in 2019; partially offset by operational challenges at one aluminum extrusions plant and the impact of the Tennessee plant transition to industrial production.42Table of ContentsSegment operating profit for this segment decreased $89, or 16%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily driven by operational challenges at one plant, higher aluminum prices, unfavorable aerospace wide-body production mix, higher transportation costs and scrap spreads, and a physical inventory adjustment of $23; partially offset by higher automotive, commercial transportation and industrial volumes.On February 1, 2020, Arconic sold its aluminum rolling mill in Itapissuma, Brazil. This rolling mill generated sales of $143 in 2019 and had 513 employees at the time of divestiture.In 2020 compared to 2019, demand from the automotive end market is expected to be up, while headwinds will continue in the commercial transportation end market. The aerospace airframe end market will be heavily influenced by the 737 MAX situation. Growth is expected with the Tennessee industrial products ramp-up. The BCS business expects continued growth and margin expansion. Net productivity improvements are also anticipated to continue.Reconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes 2019 2018 2017Total segment operating profit$2,015 $1,586 $1,689Unallocated amounts:     Impairment of goodwill— — (719)Restructuring and other charges(620) (9) (165)Corporate expense(360) (252) (325)Consolidated operating income$1,035 $1,325 $480Interest expense(338) (378) (496)Other (expense) income, net(122) (79) 486Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes$575 $868 $470See Impairment of Goodwill, Restructuring and Other Charges, Interest Expense, and Other Expense (Income), Net, discussions above under Results of Operations for reference.Corporate expense increased $108, or 43%, in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to costs associated with the planned Separation of Arconic of $78; higher annual incentive compensation accruals and executive compensation costs; environmental remediation costs for Grasse River of $25; impairment of energy business assets of $10; net impacts associated with a fire at a fasteners plant of $9 (net of insurance reimbursements); and collective bargaining agreement negotiation costs of $9; partially offset by costs incurred in 2018 that did not recur in 2019 related to settlements of certain customer claims of $38; lower costs driven by overhead cost reductions; lower research and development expenses; and lower net legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $10 primarily due to insurance reimbursements. Corporate expense decreased $73, or 22%, in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58 and costs related to the Separation of Alcoa Inc. of $18 in 2017, neither of which recurred in 2018. Also, lower expenses driven by lower annual incentive compensation accruals and overhead cost reductions were partially offset by costs incurred in the second quarter of 2018 related to the settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions of $38, an increase in legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $4, and strategy and portfolio review costs of $7 in 2018.Environmental MattersSee the Environmental Matters section of Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesArconic maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. Management continued to focus on actions to improve Arconic’s cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures.Cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Arconic’s operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.43Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents of Arconic were $1,648, of which $414 was held by Arconic's non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries were to be repatriated to the U.S., the company does not expect there to be additional material income tax consequences.Operating ActivitiesCash provided from operations in 2019 was $406 compared with $217 in 2018. The increase of $189, or 87%, was primarily due to higher operating results and lower pension contributions of $30, partially offset by higher working capital of $112. The components of the change in working capital included unfavorable changes in accounts payable of $395 and taxes, including income taxes of $106, partially offset by favorable changes in receivables of $165 and accrued expenses of $148. Cash provided from operations in 2018 was $217 compared with Cash used for operations $39 in 2017. The increase of $256 was primarily due to lower working capital of $209 and a favorable change in noncurrent liabilities of $169 due primarily to reversals in 2017 related to the Firth Rixson earn-out liability of $81 and separation-related guarantee liability of $25, partially offset by lower operating results. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes in accounts payable of $277, taxes, including income taxes of $127, and inventories of $118, partially offset by unfavorable changes in receivables of $227, accrued expenses of $74, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12.Financing ActivitiesCash used for financing activities was $1,568 in 2019 compared with $649 in 2018 and $1,015 in 2017.The use of cash in 2019 was primarily related to the repurchase of $1,150 of common stock (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data); repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 1.63% Convertible Notes of approximately $403 (see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data); and dividends paid to shareholders of $57. These items were partially offset by additions to debt for borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities of $400 and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $56.The use of cash in 2018 was principally the result of $1,103 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the then remaining outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019 (see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K) and $119 in dividends to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $600 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities.The use of cash in 2017 was principally the result of $1,634 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018, 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the 5.72% Notes due 2019 (see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K); $162 in dividends to shareholders; and $52 in premiums paid on early redemption of debt. These items were partially offset by $816 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities, and $50 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.In September 2014, Arconic completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic’s 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share, and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% Notes due 2024. The net proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this noncash equity transaction.Arconic maintains a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein that expires on June 29, 2023 and provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $3,000. In addition to the Credit Agreement, Arconic has a number of other credit agreements that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $640 as of December 31, 2019. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Arconic’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Arconic by the major credit rating agencies.On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3. On February 7, 2019, S&P placed the rating on negative credit watch and, subsequently, on April 26, S&P affirmed the long-term debt rating at BBB- but changed the outlook to negative. On January 28, 2020, S&P affirmed the long-term debt rating at BBB- but changed the outlook to stable in expectation of the separation impact. On November 1, 2016, Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) downgraded Arconic’s long-term debt rating 44Table of Contentsfrom Ba1, a non-investment grade, to Ba2 with a stable outlook and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade Liquidity-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2. Moody’s ratings and outlooks were affirmed on November 2, 2017, October 8, 2018, and October 9, 2019. On January 24, 2020, Moody’s affirmed the long-term debt rating at Ba2 but changed the outlook to negative. On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the outlook from evolving to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on July 3, 2017). On September 27, 2018, Fitch changed the outlook from stable to positive (ratings and outlook were affirmed on October 8, 2019).Investing ActivitiesCash provided from investing activities was $583 in 2019 compared with $565 in 2018 and $1,320 in 2017.The source of cash in 2019 was primarily due to cash receipts from sold receivables of $995, proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses of $103 (see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), and the sale of fixed income securities of $73, partially offset by capital expenditures of $586, including expansion of a wheels plant in Hungary, expansion of aerospace airfoils capacity in the United States, and transition of the Tennessee plant to industrial production. The source of cash in 2018 included cash receipts from sold receivables of $1,016 and proceeds from the sale of the Texarkana, Texas rolling mill and cast house of $302, partially offset by capital expenditures of $768, including the horizontal heat treat furnace at the Davenport, Iowa plant and an expansion of a wheels plant in Szekesfehervar, Hungary.The source of cash in 2017 included proceeds of $888 from the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock, cash receipts from sold receivables of $792, and the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project of $243 (see Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), somewhat offset by cash used for capital expenditures of $596, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher and horizontal heat treat furnace) at the Davenport, Iowa plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility, and the injection of $10 into the rolling business in Italy prior to its sale.Noncash Financing and Investing ActivitiesOn October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. See Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks for the remaining portion of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.45Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual Obligations. Arconic is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Arconic also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2019, a summary of Arconic’s outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 ThereafterOperating activities:         Energy-related purchase obligations$57 $29 $25 $3 $—Raw material purchase obligations569 495 64 8 2Other purchase obligations134 80 49 5 —Operating leases317 81 108 58 70Interest related to total debt1,975 344 444 344 843Estimated minimum required pension funding1,705 475 655 575 —Other postretirement benefit payments655 80 160 155 260Layoff and other restructuring payments34 34 — — —Deferred revenue arrangements36 6 30 — —Uncertain tax positions220 — — — 220Financing activities:         Total debt5,940 1,028 1,871 1,246 1,795Dividends to shareholders— — — — —Investing activities:         Capital projects401 247 121 33 —Totals$12,043 $2,899 $3,527 $2,427 $3,190Obligations for Operating ActivitiesEnergy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from one year to five years. Raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, titanium sponge, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to six years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, and health care cost trend rates, among others. It is Arconic’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Arconic contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. The estimates reported in the preceding table include amounts sufficient to meet the minimum required, along with approximately $60 of contributions in 2020 related to actions designed to reduce future obligations. Arconic has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2024 and 2029, respectively.Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs, special layoff benefit payments, and lease termination costs.Deferred revenue arrangements require Arconic to deliver product to certain customers over the specified contract period (through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract and 2021 for certain aerospace parts contracts). While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made.46Table of ContentsUncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2019. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “Thereafter” column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.Obligations for Financing ActivitiesArconic has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Arconic paid $57 in dividends to shareholders during 2019. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Arconic’s Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2019, there were 432,855,183 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding Class A preferred stock. In 2019, the preferred stock dividend was $3.75 per share and the common stock dividend was $0.12 per share.Obligations for Investing ActivitiesCapital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2019. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be less than four percent of sales in 2020.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt December 31, 2019, Arconic had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2020 and 2040 was $31 at December 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $9 and $6 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant Generation Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee. For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,353 and $1,087 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. This guarantee expires in 2047. For this guarantee, subject to its provisions, Arconic is secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation. Arconic currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote. In December 2019, Arconic entered into a one-year insurance policy with a limit of $80 relating to the remaining long-term energy supply agreement. The premium is expected to be paid by Alcoa Corporation. The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement or insurance policy will be made on an annual basis going forward.Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2020, was $142 at December 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $52 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.Arconic has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these surety bonds, which expire at various dates, primarily in 2020, was $50 at December 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $24 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.47Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters; the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future sales, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. For 2019, Arconic had seven reporting units, of which four were included in the EP&F segment (Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, Engine Products, and Forged Wheels), and three were included in the GRP segment (Global Rolled Products, Aluminum Extrusions, and BCS.)In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment 48Table of Contentsreview for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the 2019 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all seven of its reporting units. The estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 50%, thus, there was no goodwill impairment. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, capital spending, and discount rate. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.In the first quarter of 2019, management transferred its aluminum extrusions business (Aluminum Extrusions) from Engineered Structures within the EP&F segment to the GRP segment, based on synergies with the GRP segment including similar customer base, technologies, and manufacturing capabilities. Management assessed and concluded that the remaining Engineered Structures business unit and the Aluminum Extrusions business unit represent reporting units. As a result of the reorganization, goodwill of $110 was reallocated from Engineered Structures to Aluminum Extrusions and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2019. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no goodwill impairment. In the second quarter of 2019, management transferred its castings operations from Engineered Structures to Engine Products within the EP&F segment based on process expertise for investment castings that existed within Engine Products. As a result, goodwill of $105 was reallocated from Engineered Structures to Engine Products and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2019. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no impairment. As a result of the elimination of the TCS segment in the third quarter of 2019 (see Segment Information above), the Company transferred $7 of Forged Wheels goodwill and $68 of BCS goodwill from the TCS segment to the EP&F and GRP segments, respectively. Both Forged Wheels and BCS are considered reporting units.In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the decline in the forecasted financial performance and related impairment of long-lived assets of the Disks asset group within Engine Products, the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for Engine Products. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.In connection with the interim impairment evaluation of long-lived assets for the Disks asset group within Engine Products in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted from a decline in forecasted financial performance for the business in connection with its updated three-year strategic plan, the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for Engine Products. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.Goodwill impairment tests in 2018 and 2017 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units, except for the AFE business (the AFE operations were realigned and transferred to Aluminum Extrusions and Engine Products) whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value. As such, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719 in 2017. The decrease in fair value of AFE was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year.49Table of ContentsProperties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments.During the second quarter of 2019, the Company updated its five-year strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the Disks asset group within the EP&F segment. As such, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the Disks asset group long-lived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows of the Disks asset group. The carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the Disks asset group long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the long-lived assets, with fair value determined using a DCF model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence. The impairment charge of $428 recorded in the second quarter of 2019 impacted properties, plants, and equipment; intangible assets; and certain other noncurrent assets by $198, $197, and $33, respectively. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.During the second quarter of 2018, the Company updated its three-year strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the Disks asset group within the EP&F segment. As such, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing their carrying value of approximately $515 to the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the Disks asset group, resulting in an estimated fair value in excess of their carrying value of approximately 13%; thus, there was no impairment.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 3.30%, 4.35%, and 3.75%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $220 and either a charge or credit of approximately $1 to after-tax earnings in the following year.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2019, 2018, and 2017, management used 7.00%, 7.00%, and 7.75%, respectively, as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future 50Table of Contentsreturn developed by asset class. For 2020, management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. The decrease of 75 basis points in the 2018 expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $9 for 2020.In 2019, a net loss of $388 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 105 basis points, which was partially offset by the plan asset performance that was greater than expected, and by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2018, a net loss of $114 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance that permits a reclassification to Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as well as the plan asset performance that was less than expected, which were partially offset by the increase in the discount rate of 60 basis points and the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2017, a net loss of $220 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and plan asset performance less than expected, which were partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. Stock-Based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.Compensation expense recorded in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $78 ($70 after-tax), $50 ($39 after-tax), and $54 ($36 after-tax), respectively. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.The 2017 Act created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. The 2017 Act also established the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). Until regulations are finalized, judgement will be required to apply preliminary guidance, including proposed regulations, to Arconic’s facts and circumstances.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI income inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are 51Table of Contentsrecognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Management’s Reports to Arconic ShareholdersManagement’s Report on Financial Statements and PracticesThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Based on the assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. /s/ John C. PlantJohn C. PlantChairman and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Ken GiacobbeKen GiacobbeExecutive Vice President andChief Financial Officer53Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Arconic Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting PrincipleAs discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.54Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Engine Products and Engineered Structures Reporting UnitsAs described in Notes A and N to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $4,493 million as of December 31, 2019, and the amount of the goodwill associated with the Engine Products and Engineered Structures reporting units was $2,164 million and $289 million, respectively. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value using this technique requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasting operating cash flows, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, capital spending, and discount rate.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Engine Products and Engineered Structures reporting units is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurements of the reporting units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s cash flow projections and significant assumptions, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and performing sensitivity analyses over the assumptions in the model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth (volumes and pricing) and production costs involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable by considering the current and past performance of the reporting units, obtaining evidence to support the reasonableness of the assumptions, and considering whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the discounted cash flow models and certain significant assumptions, including the discount rates. Properties, Plants, and Equipment Impairment Assessment - Disks Asset GroupAs described in Notes A and M to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated properties, plants and equipment balance was $5,463 million as of December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, management recorded an impairment charge of $428 million to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived assets in the Disks asset group to their fair value, which included impairment charges to properties, plants and equipment of $198 million. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. The impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the long-lived assets, with fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods, including an estimate for economic obsolescence.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the properties, plants, and equipment impairment assessment of the Disks asset group is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the properties, plants and equipment in the Disks asset group. This in turn led to a high 55Table of Contentsdegree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s valuation methods and significant assumptions, including economic obsolescence. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s asset group impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the asset group. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating (i) the appropriateness of management’s valuation methodologies and (ii) the reasonableness of the estimated economic obsolescence utilized in determining the fair value of properties, plants and equipment in the Disks asset group.

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and subsidiaries (“Arconic” or the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and require management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation (see Note B).In the third quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its operations by eliminating its Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS) segment and transferring the Forged Wheels business to the Engineered Products and Forgings (EP&F) segment and the Building and Construction Systems (BCS) business to the Global Rolled Products (GRP) segment. See Note B for further details.On February 8, 2019, the Company announced the separation of its portfolio into two independent, publicly-traded companies (the ""Separation of Arconic""). The EP&F segment will remain in the existing company (Remain Co.) which will be renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. at separation. The GRP segment will comprise Spin Co. and will be named Arconic Corporation at separation. The Company is targeting to complete the Separation of Arconic on April 1, 2020. See Note U for further details.Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arconic and companies in which Arconic has a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which Arconic cannot exercise significant influence that do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.Management also evaluates whether an Arconic entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether Arconic is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. Arconic does not have any variable interest entities requiring consolidation.Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.Inventory Valuation. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost for approximately half of U.S. inventories determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of other inventories is determined under a combination of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average-cost methods.Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded principally on the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of structures and machinery and equipment by reporting segment (numbers in years): Structures Machinery and equipmentEngineered Products and Forgings29 17Global Rolled Products31 21Gains or losses from the sale of asset groups are generally recorded in Restructuring and other charges while the sale of individual assets are recorded in Other expense (income), net (see policy below for assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations). Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Interest related to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs.Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments. See Note M for further information.62Table of ContentsGoodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. For 2019, Arconic had seven reporting units, of which four were included in the Engineered Products and Forgings (EP&F) segment (Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, Engine Products, and Forged Wheels), and three were included in the Global Rolled Products (GRP) segment (Global Rolled Products, Aluminum Extrusions, and BCS). More than 90% of Arconic’s total goodwill at December 31, 2019 was allocated to the four EP&F reporting units: Engine Products ($2,164), Fastening Systems ($1,607), Engineered Structures ($289), and Forged Wheels ($7).In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the 2019 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all seven of its reporting units. The estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 50%, thus, there was no goodwill impairment. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a DCF model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, capital spending, and discount rate. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.In the first quarter of 2019, management transferred its aluminum extrusions business (Aluminum Extrusions) from Engineered Structures within the EP&F segment to the GRP segment, based on synergies with the GRP segment including similar customer base, technologies, and manufacturing capabilities. Management assessed and concluded that the remaining Engineered Structures business unit and the Aluminum Extrusions business unit represent reporting units. As a result of the reorganization, goodwill of $110 was reallocated from Engineered Structures to Aluminum Extrusions and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2019. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no goodwill impairment. In the second quarter of 2019, management transferred its castings operations from Engineered Structures to Engine Products within the EP&F segment based on process expertise for investment castings that existed within Engine Products. As a result, goodwill of $105 was reallocated from Engineered Structures to Engine Products and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2019. The estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value; thus, there was no impairment. As a result of the elimination of the TCS segment in the third quarter of 2019 (see Note B), the Company transferred $7 of 63Table of ContentsForged Wheels goodwill and $68 of BCS goodwill from the TCS segment to the EP&F and GRP segments, respectively. Both Forged Wheels and BCS are considered reporting units.In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the decline in the forecasted financial performance and related impairment of long-lived assets of the Disks asset group within Engine Products (see Note M), the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for Engine Products. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.In connection with the interim impairment evaluation of long-lived assets for the Disks asset group within Engine Products in the second quarter of 2018 (see Note M), which resulted from a decline in forecasted financial performance for the business in connection with its updated three-year strategic plan, the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for Engine Products. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.Goodwill impairment tests in 2018 and 2017 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units, except for the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions business (AFE) (the AFE operations were realigned and transferred to Aluminum Extrusions and Engine Products) whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value. As such, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719 in 2017. The decrease in fair value of AFE was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year.Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by reporting segment (numbers in years): Software Other intangible assetsEngineered Products and Forgings5 32Global Rolled Products5 13Leases. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company leases land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment which have been classified as operating leases. Certain real estate leases include one or more options to renew; the exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s discretion. The Company includes renewal option periods in the lease term when it is determined that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Certain of Arconic's real estate lease agreements include rental payments that either have fixed contractual increases over time or adjust periodically for inflation. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include variable lease payments. The variable portion of payments is not included in the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and is recorded as lease cost in the period incurred. The Company also rents or subleases certain real estate to third parties, which is not material to the consolidated financial statements.Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities with an initial term greater than 12 months are recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company uses an incremental collateralized borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, as most of its leases do not provide an implicit rate. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease prepayments made and were reduced by lease incentives and accrued exit costs.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future sales, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar 64Table of Contentshistorical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Revenue Recognition. The Company's contracts with customers are comprised of acknowledged purchase orders incorporating the Company’s standard terms and conditions, or for larger customers, may also generally include terms under negotiated multi-year agreements. These contracts with customers typically consist of the manufacture of products which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied upon transfer of control of the product to the customer. The Company produces fastening systems; seamless rolled rings; investment castings, including airfoils and forged jet engine components; extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts; aluminum sheet and plate; integrated aluminum structural systems; architectural extrusions; and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels. Transfer of control is assessed based on alternative use of the products we produce and our enforceable right to payment for performance to date under the contract terms. Transfer of control and revenue recognition generally occur upon shipment or delivery of the product, which is when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (truck, train, or vessel). An invoice for payment is issued at time of shipment. Our business units set commercial terms on which Arconic sells products to its customers. These terms are influenced by industry custom, market conditions, product line (specialty versus commodity products), and other considerations.In certain circumstances, Arconic receives advanced payments from its customers for product to be delivered in future periods. These advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the product is delivered and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred revenue is included in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) income inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.65Table of ContentsStock-Based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.Foreign Currency. The local currency is the functional currency for Arconic’s significant operations outside the United States, except for certain operations in Canada and Russia, where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. The determination of the functional currency for Arconic’s operations is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators.Acquisitions. Arconic’s business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Statement of Consolidated Operations from the date of the acquisition.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. For those businesses where management has committed to a plan to divest, each business is valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets of a business to be divested once they are classified as held for sale. Businesses to be divested are generally classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as either discontinued operations or held for sale.For businesses classified as discontinued operations, the balance sheet amounts and results of operations should be reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, respectively, for all periods presented. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows is not required to be reclassified for discontinued operations for any period. Segment information does not include the assets or operating results of businesses classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These businesses are expected to be disposed of within one year.For businesses classified as held for sale that do not qualify for discontinued operations treatment, the balance sheet and cash flow amounts should be reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale for all periods presented. The results of operations continue to be reported in continuing operations. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The segment information includes the assets and operating results of businesses classified as held for sale for all periods presented.Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued changes to the accounting and presentation of leases. These changes require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments for all operating leases with a term greater than 12 months.These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019 and have been applied using the modified retrospective approach as of the date of adoption, under which leases existing at, or entered into after, January 1, 2019 were required to be recognized and measured. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reflected in accordance with the Company’s historical accounting. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company also elected to separate lease components from non-lease components for all classes of assets.The adoption of this new lease standard resulted in the Company recording operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $320 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. Also, the Company reclassified cash proceeds of $119 from Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits, assets of $24 from Properties, plants, and equipment, net, and deferred tax assets of $22 from Other noncurrent assets to Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) reflecting the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the sale-leaseback of the Texarkana, Texas cast house (see Note S). The adoption of the standard had no impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations or Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.66Table of ContentsIn August 2017, the FASB issued guidance that made more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amended the presentation and disclosure requirements and changed how companies assess effectiveness. It is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019. For cash flow hedges, Arconic recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2 related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness by decreasing Accumulated other comprehensive loss and increasing Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amendments to presentation and disclosure are required prospectively. Arconic has determined that under the new accounting guidance it is able to more broadly use cash flow hedge accounting for its variable priced inventory purchases and customer sales.In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows an optional reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. Stranded tax effects were created when deferred taxes, originally established in Other comprehensive income at 35%, were revalued to 21% as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. The Company elected to early adopt this provision in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reclassified $367 of beneficial stranded tax effects in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity.In March 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance to modernize and simplify certain disclosure requirements in a manner that reduces the costs and burdens on preparers while continuing to provide all material information to investors. This guidance became effective on May 2, 2019 and has been applied to filings thereafter. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. In June 2016, the FASB added a new impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments, trade receivables, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and other loan commitments. The CECL model does not have a minimum threshold for recognition of impairment losses and entities will need to measure expected credit losses on assets that have a low risk of loss. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2020. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that impacts disclosures for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These changes become effective for Arconic's annual report for the year ending December 31, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance that is intended to simplify various aspects related to the accounting for income taxes. These changes become effective on January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements.B. Segment and Geographic Area InformationArconic is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, industrial applications, defense, and packaging. Arconic’s operations consist of two worldwide reportable segments: EP&F and GRP. Segment performance under Arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Arconic’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and other charges and Impairment of goodwill. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between segment totals and consolidated Arconic are in Corporate. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company realigned its operations by eliminating its TCS segment and transferring the Forged Wheels business to its EP&F segment and BCS to its GRP segment, consistent with how the Chief Executive Officer is assessing operating performance and allocating capital in conjunction with the planned Separation of Arconic (see Note U). The Latin America extrusions business, which was formerly part of the Company's TCS segment until its sale in April of 2018 (see Note S), was moved to Corporate. In the first quarter of 2019, management transferred its aluminum extrusions operations from its Engineered Structures business unit within the EP&F segment to the GRP segment, based on synergies with the GRP segment including similar customer base, technologies, and manufacturing capabilities. Prior period financial information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note A). Transactions among segments are established based on negotiation among the parties. Differences between segment totals and Arconic’s consolidated totals for line items not reconciled are in Corporate.67Table of ContentsEngineered Products and Forgings. This segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (aluminum, titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils; forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks); extruded, machined and forged aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum); and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Approximately 70% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged and machined metal products (titanium and aluminum) for various end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are experienced for certain products in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown.Global Rolled Products. This segment produces aluminum sheet and plate, aluminum extruded and machined parts, integrated aluminum structural systems, and architectural extrusions used in the automotive, aerospace, building and construction, industrial, packaging, and commercial transportation end markets. Products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate are to a relatively small number of customers.68Table of ContentsThe operating results and assets of Arconic’s reportable segments were as follows: Engineered Products and Forgings Global Rolled Products Total2019     Sales:     Third-party sales$7,105 $7,082 $14,187Intersegment sales— 183 183Total segment sales$7,105 $7,265 $14,370Profit and loss:     Segment operating profit$1,390 $625 $2,015Restructuring and other charges509 81 590Provision for depreciation and amortization269 233 5022018     Sales:     Third-party sales$6,798 $7,223 $14,021Intersegment sales— 205 205Total segment sales$6,798 $7,428 $14,226Profit and loss:     Segment operating profit$1,105 $481 $1,586Restructuring and other charges70 (157) (87)Provision for depreciation and amortization289 253 5422017     Sales:     Third-party sales$6,300 $6,540 $12,840Intersegment sales— 183 183Total segment sales$6,300 $6,723 $13,023Profit and loss:     Segment operating profit$1,119 $570 $1,689Restructuring and other charges30 83 113Provision for depreciation and amortization275 243 5182019     Assets:     Capital expenditures$344 $189 $533Goodwill4,067 426 4,493Total assets(1)10,034 4,907 14,9412018     Assets:     Capital expenditures$407 $308 $715Goodwill4,186 314 4,500Total assets10,494 4,845 15,339(1) Segment assets at December 31, 2019 included operating lease right-of-use assets (see Notes A and O).

In 2019, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $620 ($512 after-tax), this included a non-cash charge for asset impairments of $570 ($477 after-tax), primarily comprised of $428 ($345 after-tax) for impairment of the Disks long-lived asset group, a charge of $112 ($109 after-tax) for impairment of assets associated with agreements to sell the Company’s Brazilian rolling mill operations ($53), the U.K. forgings business ($46), and a small additive business ($13), a charge of $25 ($19 after-tax) for impairment of a trade name intangible asset and properties, plant, and equipment related to the Company’s primary research and development facility, and a charge of $5 ($4 after-tax) for an impairment of a cost method investment of the GRP segment; a charge of $103 ($78 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 72Table of Contents1,310 employees (484 in the GRP segment, 460 in Corporate, and 366 in the EP&F segment); a charge of $26 ($21 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items including lease terminations of $12 primarily related to a corporate aircraft, accelerated depreciation of $9, a net charge of $2 for executive severance net of the benefit of forfeited executive stock compensation, and a charge for various other exit costs of $4; and a charge of $9 ($7 after-tax) for pension settlement accounting. These charges were partially offset by a benefit of $58 ($45 after-tax) from the elimination of the life insurance benefit for the U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries; a benefit of $10 ($9 after-tax) from the reversal of a number of current year layoff reserves; and a gain of $20 ($17 after-tax) for contingent consideration received from the Texarkana sale.As of December 31, 2019, approximately 947 of the 1,310 employees were separated. The remaining separations for the 2019 restructuring programs are expected to be completed in 2020. In 2019, cash payments of $65 were made against layoff reserves related to 2019 restructuring programs.2018 Actions. In 2018, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $9 ($9 after-tax), which included a net gain on the sale of several assets and businesses of $109 ($81 after-tax), primarily made up of a gain on the asset sale of Texarkana of $154 ($119 after-tax) and loss on the sale of the Hungary forgings business of $43 ($39 after-tax) (see note S); charges of $96 ($75 after-tax) for pension settlement and $23 ($18 after-tax) for pension curtailment; a postretirement curtailment benefit of $28 ($22 after-tax) (see note F); and a charge of $20 ($17 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 125 employees (89 in the EP&F segment and 36 in Corporate); a charge of $12 ($9 after-tax) for contract termination costs and asset impairments associated with the shutdown of a facility in Acuna, Mexico; a charge of $6 ($4 after-tax) for contract termination costs related to the New York office; a charge of $8 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments; and a benefit of $19 ($15 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2019, the separations associated with the 2018 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2019 and 2018, cash payments of $4 and $9, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to the 2018 restructuring programs.2017 Actions. In 2017, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $165 ($143 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: a charge of $69 ($47 after-tax) for layoff costs related to cost reduction initiatives including the separation of approximately 880 employees (403 in the EP&F segment, 336 in the GRP segment, and 141 in Corporate), a charge of $60 ($60 after-tax) related to the sale of the Italy rolling mill; a charge of $41 ($41 after-tax) for the impairment of assets associated with the sale of the Latin America extrusions business (see Note S); a net benefit of $6 ($4 after-tax) for the reversal of forfeited executive stock compensation of $13, partially offset by a charge of $7 for the related severance; a net charge of $12 ($7 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and a benefit of $11 ($8 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2019, the separations associated with the 2017 restructuring programs were essentially complete.

Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsArconic maintains pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in foreign locations. Pension benefits generally depend on length of service and job grade. Substantially all benefits are paid through pension trusts that are sufficiently funded to ensure that all plans can pay benefits to retirees as they become due. Most salaried and non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after March 1, 2006, participate in a defined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.Arconic also maintains health care and life insurance postretirement benefit plans covering eligible U.S. retired employees and certain retirees from foreign locations. Generally, the medical plans are unfunded and pay a percentage of medical expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life benefits are generally provided by insurance contracts. Arconic retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to change or eliminate these benefits. All salaried and certain non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2002 and certain bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after July 1, 2010, are not eligible for postretirement health care benefits. All salaried and certain hourly U.S. employees that retire on or after April 1, 2008 are not eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits.Effective January 1, 2015, Arconic no longer offers postretirement health care benefits to Medicare-eligible, primarily non-bargaining, U.S. retirees through Company-sponsored plans. Qualifying retirees (hired prior to January 1, 2002), both current and future, may access these benefits in the marketplace by purchasing coverage directly from insurance carriers.On April 1, 2018, benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company's qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly employees ceased. As a result of this change, in 2018, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued pension benefit liability of $136 related to the reduction of future benefits ($141 offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss) and curtailment charges of $5 in Restructuring and other charges.On April 13, 2018, the United Auto Workers ratified a new five-year labor agreement, covering approximately 1,300 U.S. employees of Arconic, which expires on March 31, 2023. A provision within the agreement includes a retirement benefit increase for future retirees that participate in a defined benefit pension plan, which impacts approximately 300 of those employees. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, benefit accruals for future service ceased. As result of these changes, in 2018, a curtailment charge of $9 was recorded in Restructuring and other charges. In 2018, the Company announced that effective December 31, 2018, it would end all pre-Medicare medical, prescription drug and vision coverage for current and future salaried and non-bargained hourly employees and retirees of the Company and its 75Table of Contentssubsidiaries. As a result of this change, in 2018, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued other postretirement benefits liability of $32 related to the reduction of future benefits, $4 offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and a curtailment benefit of $28 in Restructuring and other charges.In 2018, the company communicated to plan participants that effective in the first quarter of 2019, benefit accruals for future service and compensation for employees in the United Kingdom defined benefit pension plans will cease. The plan curtailment resulted in a $13 decrease in the Accrued pension benefits liability which was offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, on October 29, 2018, the United Kingdom High Court ruled that defined benefit pension plans offering Guaranteed Minimum Pensions must review benefits accrued between May 1990 to April 1997 to ensure gender pay equality. The review resulted in an increase to the Accrued pension benefits liability of $9 and a corresponding curtailment charge that was recorded in Restructuring and other charges.In 2019, the Company communicated to plan participants that for its U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries, it would eliminate the life insurance benefit effective May 1, 2019, and certain health care subsidies effective December 31, 2019. As a result of these changes, in 2019, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued other postretirement benefits liability of $75, which was offset by a curtailment benefit of $58 in Restructuring and other charges and $17 in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.In June 2019, the Company and the United Steelworkers (USW) reached a tentative three-year labor agreement that was ratified on July 11, 2019 covering approximately 3,400 employees at four U.S. locations; the previous labor agreement expired on May 15, 2019.  In 2019, the Company recognized $9 in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations primarily for a one-time signing bonus for employees. Additionally, on July 25, 2019, the USW ratified a new four-year labor agreement covering approximately 560 employees at the Company’s Niles, Ohio facility. The prior labor agreement expired on June 30, 2018.In 2019 and 2018, the Company applied settlement accounting to U.S. pension plans due to lump sum payments to participants which resulted in settlement charges of $9 and $96 that were recorded in Restructuring and other charges.76Table of ContentsThe funded status of all of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of December 31 each calendar year.Obligations and Funded Status Pension benefits Otherpostretirement benefitsDecember 31,2019 2018 2019 2018Change in benefit obligation       Benefit obligation at beginning of year$6,476 $7,359 $806 $927Service cost25 46 7 7Interest cost235 219 28 28Amendments— 18 (78) (25)Actuarial losses (gains)974 (372) 100 (51)Settlements(23) (146) — —Curtailments— (154) — —Benefits paid(477) (422) (82) (86)Medicare Part D subsidy receipts— — 5 6Foreign currency translation impact39 (72) — —Benefit obligation at end of year(1)$7,249 $6,476 $786 $806Change in plan assets(1)       Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$4,334 $4,862 $— $—Actual return on plan assets731 (144) — —Employer contributions268 298 — —Benefits paid(453) (397) — —Administrative expenses(34) (33) — —Settlements(22) (178) — —Foreign currency translation impact44 (74) — —Fair value of plan assets at end of year(1)$4,868 $4,334 $— $—Net funded status$(2,381) $(2,142) $(786) $(806)Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of:       Noncurrent assets$104 $111 $— $—Current liabilities(25) (23) (72) (83)Noncurrent liabilities(2,460) (2,230) (714) (723)Net amount recognized$(2,381) $(2,142) $(786) $(806)Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:       Net actuarial loss$3,375 $2,957 $179 $87Prior service cost (benefit)1 3 (37) (27)Net amount recognized, before tax effect$3,376 $2,960 $142 $60Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:       Net actuarial loss (gain)$566 $(19) $100 $(52)Amortization of accumulated net actuarial loss(148) (264) (8) (7)Prior service cost (benefit)— 19 (78) (25)Amortization of prior service (cost) benefit(2) (26) 68 35Net amount recognized, before tax effect$416 $(290) $82 $(49)77Table of Contents(1) At December 31, 2019, the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status for U.S. pension plans were $5,884, $3,513, and $(2,371), respectively.

The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times.Benefit accruals for future compensation under the Company’s major salaried and non-bargained hourly defined benefit pension plans have ceased. The rate of compensation increase no longer impacts the determination of the benefit obligation and is not reported in the preceding table effective December 31, 2019. Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (assumptions for non-U.S. plans did not differ materially): 2019 2018 2017Discount rate to calculate service cost(1)4.35% 3.75% 4.20%Discount rate to calculate interest cost(1)4.00 3.30 3.60Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets7.00 7.00 7.75Rate of compensation increase3.50 3.50 3.50Cash balance plan interest crediting rate3.00 3.00 3.00(1) In all periods presented, the respective discount rates were used to determine net periodic benefit cost for most U.S. pension plans for the full annual period. However, the discount rates for a limited number of plans were updated during 2019, 2018, and 2017 to reflect the remeasurement of these plans due to new union labor agreements, settlements, and/or curtailments. The updated discount rates used were not significantly different from the discount rates presented.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2019, 2018, and 2017, the expected long-term rate of return used by management was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2018, management reduced the expected long-term rate of return by 75 basis points due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average. For 2020, management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. Assumed health care cost trend rates for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (assumptions for non-U.S. plans did not differ materially): 2019 2018 2017Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year5.50% 5.50% 5.50%Rate to which the cost trend rate gradually declines4.50 4.50 4.50Year that the rate reaches the rate at which it is assumed to remain2023 2022 202179Table of ContentsThe assumed health care cost trend rate is used to measure the expected cost of gross eligible charges covered by Arconic’s other postretirement benefit plans. For 2020, a 5.5% trend rate will be used, reflecting management’s best estimate of the change in future health care costs covered by the plans. The plans’ actual annual health care cost trend experience over the past three years has ranged from (3.8)% to 0.7%. Management does not believe this three-year range is indicative of expected increases for future health care costs over the long-term.Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in these assumed rates would have the following effects: 1% increase 1% decreaseEffect on other postretirement benefit obligations$23 $(22)Effect on total of service and interest cost components1 (1)Plan AssetsArconic’s pension plans’ investment policy and weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset class, were as follows:  Plan assetsatDecember 31,Asset classPolicy range2019 2018Equities20–55%31% 29%Fixed income25–55%50 48Other investments15–35%19 23Total 100% 100%The principal objectives underlying the investment of the pension plans’ assets are to ensure that Arconic can properly fund benefit obligations as they become due under a broad range of potential economic and financial scenarios, maximize the long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on such obligations, and broadly diversify investments across and within various asset classes to protect asset values against adverse movements. Specific objectives for long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities and achieving diversification across the balance of the asset portfolio. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The investment strategy uses long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities. Exposure to broad equity risk is decreased and diversified through investments in discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds, long/short equity hedge funds, high yield bonds, emerging market debt and global and emerging market equities. Investments are further diversified by strategy, asset class, geography, and sector to enhance returns and mitigate downside risk. A large number of external investment managers are used to gain broad exposure to the financial markets and to mitigate manager-concentration risk.Investment practices comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and other applicable laws and regulations.The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified (see Note Q for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy).Equities. These securities consist of: (i) direct investments in the stock of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. companies, and equity derivatives, that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (ii) the plans’ share of commingled funds that are invested in the stock of publicly traded companies and are valued at the net asset value of shares held at December 31 (included in Level 1); and (iii) direct investments in long/short equity hedge funds and private equity (limited partnerships and venture capital partnerships) that are valued at net asset value.Fixed income. These securities consist of: (i) U.S. government debt that are generally valued using quoted prices (included in Level 1); (ii) cash and cash equivalents invested in publicly-traded funds and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (iii) publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally corporate bonds and debentures) and are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data (included in Level 2); 80Table of Contents(iv) fixed income derivatives that are generally valued using industry standard models with market-based observable inputs (included in Level 2); and (v) cash and cash equivalents invested in institutional funds and are valued at net asset value.Other investments. These investments include, among others: (i) exchange traded funds, such as gold, and real estate investment trusts and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the investments are traded (included in Level 1) and (ii) direct investments of discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds and private real estate (includes limited partnerships) and are valued at net asset value.The fair value methods described above may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Additionally, while Arconic believes the valuation methods used by the plans’ trustees are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.The following table presents the fair value of pension plan assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy or net asset cost:December 31, 2019Level 1 Level 2 Net asset value TotalEquities:   Equity securities$590 $— $508 $1,098Long/short equity hedge funds— — 260 260Private equity— — 155 155 $590 $— $923 $1,513Fixed income:   Intermediate and long duration government/credit$121 $1,047 $1,003 $2,171Other126 7 144 277 $247 $1,054 $1,147 $2,448Other investments:   Real estate$104 $— $165 $269Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds— — 405 405Other— — 240 240 $104 $— $810 $914Net plan assets(1)$941 $1,054 $2,880 $4,875December 31, 2018Level 1 Level 2 Net Asset Value TotalEquities       Equity securities$318 $— $578 $896Long/short equity hedge funds— — 232 232Private equity— — 147 147 $318 $— $957 $1,275Fixed income:      Intermediate and long duration government/credit$200 $934 $770 $1,904Other9 9 152 170 $209 $943 $922 $2,074Other investments:       Real estate$81 $— $164 $245Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds— — 471 471Other56 — 212 268 $137 $— $847 $984Net plan assets(2)$664 $943 $2,726 $4,333(1) As of December 31, 2019, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net payable of $7, which represents securities purchased and sold but not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.(2) As of December 31, 2018, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net receivable of $1, which represents securities purchased and sold but not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.81Table of ContentsFunding and Cash FlowsIt is Arconic’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Arconic contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. In 2019 and 2018, cash contributions to Arconic’s pension plans were $268 and $298, respectively. The $268 includes $53 contributed to the Company’s U.S. plans that was in excess of the minimum required under ERISA.The contribution to the Company’s pension plans in 2020 is estimated to be $475 (of which $403 is for U.S. plans). The minimum required is $415, along with approximately $60 of contributions related to actions designed to reduce future obligations. During the third quarter of 2016, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation approved management’s plan to separate the Alcoa Inc. pension plans between Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation. The plan stipulated that Arconic make cash contributions of $150 over a period of 30 months (from November 1, 2016) to its two largest pension plans. The Company satisfied the requirements of the plan by making payments of $34, $66, and $50 in April 2019, March 2018, and April 2017, respectively.Benefit payments expected to be paid to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ participants and expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts are as follows utilizing the current assumptions outlined above:For the year ended December 31,Pensionbenefits paid Gross Other post-retirementbenefits Medicare Part Dsubsidy receipts Net Other post-retirementbenefits2020$470 $80 $5 $752021465 80 5 752022460 80 5 752023455 80 5 752024450 75 5 70Thereafter2,120 260 25 235 $4,420 $655 $50 $605Defined Contribution PlansArconic sponsors savings and investment plans in various countries, primarily in the United States. Arconic’s contributions and expenses related to these plans were $125, $123, and $89 in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In the United States, employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, and Arconic matches a portion of these contributions in equivalent form of the investments elected by the employee.G.

The benefit is partially offset by an increase in uncertain tax positions. Losses reported in Spain's 2017 tax return related to the Separation of Alcoa are offset by an increased valuation allowance.(2) In 2018, the Company finalized its accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""the 2017 Act”) and recorded an additional $59 charge. In December 2017, an estimated $272 tax charge was recorded with respect to the enactment of the 2017 Act.(3) In 2019, the Company released a valuation allowance related to 2015 and 2016 foreign tax credits, subsequent to filing U.S. amended tax returns to deduct, rather than credit, foreign taxes.(4) In 2019, the Company filed U.S. amended tax returns to deduct, rather than credit, 2015 and 2016 foreign taxes resulting in a tax cost associated with the write-off of the deferred tax asset for the credit, partially offset by a tax benefit for the deduction.83Table of ContentsOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017. Also on December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was issued by the SEC to address the application of U.S. GAAP for financial reporting. SAB 118 permitted the use of provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates in the financial statements. SAB 118 also provided that the tax impact may be considered incomplete in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act.The Company calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the 2017 Act’s tax rate reduction and one-time transition tax in its 2017 year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the 2017 Act and guidance available and, as a result, recorded a $272 tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.In 2018, the Company included a $59 tax charge in income from continuing operations as a result of finalizing its accounting for the 2017 Tax Act in accordance with SAB 118. This charge primarily related to a $16 charge for the one-time transition tax and a $43 charge to update deferred tax balances.The components of net deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: 2019 2018December 31,Deferredtaxassets Deferredtaxliabilities Deferredtaxassets DeferredtaxliabilitiesDepreciation$25 $729 $38 $694Employee benefits887 16 836 27Loss provisions92 — 94 —Deferred income/expense96 943 22 1,102Interest56 — — —Tax loss carryforwards2,932 — 3,159 —Tax credit carryforwards379 — 579 —Other52 16 94 20 $4,519 $1,704 $4,822 $1,843Valuation allowance(2,256) — (2,486) — $2,263 $1,704 $2,336 $1,843The following table details the expiration periods of the deferred tax assets presented above:December 31, 2019Expireswithin10 years Expireswithin11-20 years Noexpiration(1) Other(2) TotalTax loss carryforwards$452 $235 $2,245 $— $2,932Tax credit carryforwards300 69 10 — 379Other— — 120 1,088 1,208Valuation allowance(711) (176) (1,306) (63) (2,256) $41 $128 $1,069 $1,025 $2,263(1) Deferred tax assets with no expiration may still have annual limitations on utilization.

A substantial amount of Other relates to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes over an extended period of time as contributions are made to employee benefit plans and payments are made to retirees.The total deferred tax asset (net of valuation allowance) is supported by projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences (27%) and taxable temporary differences that reverse within the carryforward period (73%).Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of 84Table of Contentstaxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI income inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2020 to 2028 (as of December 31, 2019). Valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period. After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies, incremental valuation allowances of $46 and $9 were recognized in 2018 and 2017, respectively. No additional valuation allowance was recorded in 2019 as the Company intends to deduct, rather than credit, foreign taxes. Foreign tax credits of $88, $8, and $57 expired at the end of 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance was also reduced by $113 as a result of Arconic deducting foreign taxes that were previously claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $216. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.Arconic also recorded a valuation allowance of $10 related to capital losses and capital investments in 2019. Capital losses can only offset capital gain income. Arconic does not have sufficient sources of capital gain income to support the utilization of these losses and investments. The need for valuation allowances against capital losses and investments will be reassessed on a continuing basis.Arconic released $13 and $10 of certain U.S. state valuation allowances in 2019 and 2018, respectively. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that the underlying net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income estimates. Valuation allowances of $672 remain against other net state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization. The need for valuation allowances against net state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. In 2018, Arconic reduced a valuation allowance by $92 as a result of increasing a tax reserve for unrecognized tax benefits in Spain. The valuation allowance reduction was partially offset by a $20 charge with respect to losses no longer supported by reversing temporary differences. Arconic also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $61 and $675 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which offsets a deferred tax asset recorded for additional losses reported on the Spanish tax return related to the Separation of Alcoa that are not more likely than not to be realized.85Table of ContentsThe following table details the changes in the valuation allowance:December 31,2019 2018 2017Balance at beginning of year$2,486 $2,584 $1,940Increase to allowance37 136 831Release of allowance(222) (154) (246)Acquisitions and divestitures(2) — (1)Tax apportionment, tax rate and tax law changes(13) (14) (24)Foreign currency translation(30) (66) 84Balance at end of year$2,256 $2,486 $2,584As a result of the 2017 Act, the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (calculated based on U.S. tax principles) of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations has been subject to U.S. tax under the one-time transition tax provisions. The 2017 Act also created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, GILTI, must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. The 2017 Act also established the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). In the first quarter of 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to treat taxes due from future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Arconic has estimated a GILTI inclusion for 2019 and 2018 and recorded tax expense accordingly. Arconic does not anticipate being subject to BEAT for 2019 and 2018.Foreign U.S. GAAP earnings that have not otherwise been subject to U.S. tax, will generally be exempt from future U.S. tax under the 2017 Act when distributed.  Such distributions, as well as distributions of previously taxed foreign earnings, could potentially be subject to U.S. state tax in certain states, and foreign withholding taxes. Foreign currency gains/losses related to the translation of previously taxed earnings from functional currency to U.S. dollars could also be subject to U.S. tax when distributed.  At this time, Arconic has no plans to distribute such earnings in the foreseeable future. If such earnings were to be distributed, Arconic would expect the potential U.S. state tax and withholding tax impacts to be immaterial and the potential deferred tax liability associated with future foreign currency gains to be impracticable to determine.Arconic and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With a few minor exceptions, Arconic is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2006. All U.S. tax years prior to 2019 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining Arconic’s income tax returns for various tax years through 2018.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was as follows:December 31,2019 2018 2017Balance at beginning of year$166 $73 $28Additions for tax positions of the current year34 — 23Additions for tax positions of prior years3 143 27Reductions for tax positions of prior years— (42) —Settlements with tax authorities— — —Expiration of the statute of limitations(2) (6) (5)Foreign currency translation(4) (2) —Balance at end of year$197 $166 $73For all periods presented, a portion of the balance pertains to state tax liabilities, which are presented before any offset for federal tax benefits. The effect of unrecognized tax benefits, if recorded, that would impact the annual effective tax rate for 2019, 2018, and 2017 would be approximately 13%, 5%, and 15%, respectively, of pre-tax book income. Arconic does not anticipate that changes in its unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations during 2020.It is Arconic’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the Provision for income taxes on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. Arconic recognized interest of $6, $22 and $1 for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, settlements with tax authorities, and refunded overpayments, Arconic recognized interest income of $0, $1, and $2 in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the amount accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was $23, $21, and $2, respectively.86Table of ContentsH. Preferred and Common StockPreferred Stock. Arconic has two classes of preferred stock: Class A Preferred Stock and Class B Serial Preferred Stock. Class A Preferred Stock has 660,000 shares authorized at a par value of $100 per share with an annual $3.75 cumulative dividend preference per share. There were 546,024 shares of Class A Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Class B Serial Preferred Stock has 10,000,000 shares authorized at a par value of $1 per share. There were no shares of Class B Serial Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 (see below).In September 2014, Arconic completed a public offering under its shelf registration statement for $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each of which represented a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic’s 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share (the “Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). The 25 million depositary shares were equivalent to 2.5 million shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Each depositary share entitled the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation, and voting rights, subject to terms of the deposit agreement. Arconic received $1,213 in net proceeds from the public offering reflecting an underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used, together with the net proceeds of issued debt, to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. The underwriting discount was recorded as a decrease to Additional capital. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock constituted a series of Arconic’s Class B Serial Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to Arconic’s common stock and junior to Arconic’s Class A Preferred Stock and existing and future indebtedness. Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock generally had no voting rights.Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were cumulative in nature and paid at the rate of $26.8750 per annum per share in 2016 and 2015, which commenced January 1, 2015 (paid on December 30, 2014). On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were paid at the rate of $20.1563 per share in 2017.Common Stock. At December 31, 2019, there were 600,000,000 shares authorized and 432,855,183 shares issued and outstanding. Dividends paid of $0.12 per annum ($0.06 dividend in the first quarter of 2019 and $0.02 per quarter for the remainder of the year) in 2019 and $0.24 per annum or $0.06 per quarter in 2018 and 2017.As of December 31, 2019, 47 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under Arconic’s stock-based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2019, 37 million shares remain available for issuance. Arconic issues new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options and the conversion of stock awards.In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI International Metals Inc. (RTI), Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche was due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder’s option under specific conditions. No shares of the Company’s common stock were issued in connection with the maturity or final conversion of this convertible debt.

On May 2, 2019, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank to repurchase $200 of its common stock (the “May 2019 ASR”), pursuant to the share repurchase programs previously authorized by its Board. Under the May 2019 ASR, Arconic received an initial delivery of shares on May 6, 2019 and additional shares on June 12, 2019. On May 14, 2019, the Board authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $500 of its outstanding common stock. On August 6, 2019, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to repurchase $200 of its common stock (the “August 2019 ASR”), pursuant to the share repurchase programs previously authorized by its Board. Under the August 2019 ASR, Arconic received an initial delivery of shares on August 8, 2019 and additional shares on October 3, 2019. On November 14, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. to repurchase $50 of its common stock (the “November 2019 share repurchase program”), pursuant to the share repurchase programs previously authorized by its Board. All of the shares repurchased during 2019 were immediately retired. After giving effect to the February 2019 ASR, May 2019 ASR, August 2019 ASR, and November 2019 share repurchase program, $350 remains available under the prior authorizations by the Board for share repurchases through the end of 2020.The following table provides details for the share repurchases during 2019.Share delivery dateNumber of shares Average price TotalFebruary 21, 201931,908,831    April 29, 20194,525,592    February 2019 ASR total36,434,423 $19.21 $700      May 6, 20197,455,732    June 12, 20191,561,249    May 2019 ASR total9,016,981 $22.18 $200      August 8, 20196,791,172    October 3, 2019983,107    August 2019 ASR total7,774,279 $25.73 $200      November 18, 2019428,000    November 19, 2019428,000    November 20, 2019370,000    November 21, 2019400,681    November 2019 share repurchase program1,626,681 $30.74 $50      2019 Share repurchase total54,852,364 $20.97 $1,150Stock-Based CompensationArconic has a stock-based compensation plan under which stock options and/or restricted stock unit awards are granted in the first quarter of each year to eligible employees. Stock options are granted at the closing market price of Arconic’s common stock on the date of grant and typically vest over a three-year service period (1/3 each year) with a ten-year contractual term. Restricted stock unit awards typically vest over a three-year service period from the date of grant. As part of Arconic’s stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. Certain of the restricted stock unit awards include performance and market conditions and are granted to a limited number of eligible employees. In 2019, performance stock awards were granted to the CEO that vest either based on achievement of the planned Separation of Arconic (see Note U for further details) or the achievement of certain stock price thresholds. Performance stock awards granted in the first quarter of 2019 were converted to restricted stock unit awards (at target), in order to address the planned Separation of Arconic. For performance stock awards issued in 2018 and 2017, the final number of shares earned will be based on Arconic’s achievement of sales and profitability targets over the respective performance periods and will be earned at the end of the third year. Additionally, the 2018 and 2017 performance stock awards will be scaled by a total shareholder return (“TSR”) multiplier, which depends upon relative performance against the TSRs of a group of peer companies.In conjunction with their employment agreements, certain current and former executives were granted cash bonus awards based on the achievement of certain stock price thresholds. These awards are liability classified and were marked-to-market each 88Table of Contentsquarter using a Monte Carlo simulation. At the end of the year, the stock price thresholds have been fully reached. The cash payment of $23 will occur in 2021 in accordance with the terms of the agreements.In 2019, 2018, and 2017, Arconic recognized stock-based compensation expense of $78 ($70 after-tax), $50 ($39 after-tax), and $54 ($36 after-tax), respectively. Cash bonus awards of $21 were recorded in 2019. Of the remaining stock-based compensation expense in 2019, more than 95% relates to restricted stock unit awards. The expense related to restricted stock unit awards in 2018 and 2017 was approximately 85%. No stock-based compensation expense was capitalized in any of those years. Stock-based compensation expense was reduced by $3 and $13 in 2019 and 2017, respectively, for certain executive pre-vest cancellations which were recorded in Restructuring and other charges within the Statement of Consolidated Operations. At December 31, 2019, there was $50 (pre-tax) of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants and non-vested restricted stock unit award grants. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of the applicable equity grant. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value was equivalent to the closing market price of Arconic’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of the 2019 performance stock awards with a market condition (achievement of certain stock price thresholds) was $11.93. The grant date fair value of the 2018 performance stock awards containing a market condition (scaled by TSR multiplier) was $20.25. The 2019 and 2018 performance awards were valued using a Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo simulation uses assumptions of stock price behavior to estimate the probability of satisfying market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The risk-free interest rate (1.6% in 2019 and 2.7% in 2018) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the remaining performance period. In 2019 volatility was estimated using implied and historical volatility (33.4%). Because of limited historical information due to the Separation of Alcoa, 2018 volatility (32.0%) was estimated using implied volatility, and the representative price return approach, which uses price returns of comparable companies, was used to develop a correlation assumption. For stock options, the fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model, which generated a result of $9.79 and $6.26 per option in 2018 and 2017, respectively. There were no stock options issued in 2019. The lattice-pricing model uses a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value of a stock option, including a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, exercise behavior, and contractual life. The following paragraph describes in detail the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2018 (the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2017 were not materially different, except as noted below).The risk-free interest rate (2.5%) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the contractual life of the option. The dividend yield (0.9%) was based on a one-year average. Volatility (34.0% for 2018 and 38.1% in 2017) was based on comparable companies and implied volatilities over the term of the option. Arconic utilized historical option forfeiture data to estimate annual post-vesting forfeitures (6%). Exercise behavior (61%) was based on a weighted average exercise ratio (exercise patterns for grants issued over the number of years in the contractual option term) of an option’s intrinsic value resulting from historical employee exercise behavior. Based upon the other assumptions used in the determination of the fair value, the life of an option (6.0 years) was an output of the lattice-pricing model. The activity for stock options and stock awards during 2019 was as follows (options and awards in millions): Stock options Stock awards  Number ofoptions Weightedaverageexercise price Number ofawards Weightedaverage FMVper awardOutstanding, December 31, 201810 $24.95 7 $21.13Granted — — 4 19.80Exercised(2) 21.34 — —Converted— — (3) 15.78Expired or forfeited(1) 28.37 (1) 22.10Performance share adjustment— — — 19.96Outstanding, December 31, 20197 $25.75 7 $22.05As of December 31, 2019, the number of stock options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.4 years and a total intrinsic value of $40. Additionally, 5.9 million of the stock options outstanding were fully vested and exercisable and had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.0 years, a weighted average exercise price of $25.80, and a total intrinsic value of $36 as of December 31, 2019. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, the cash received from stock option exercises was $56, $16, and $50 and the total tax benefit realized from these exercises was $4, $2, and $4, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $17, $7, and $13, respectively.89Table of ContentsI. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are computed by dividing earnings (loss), after the deduction of preferred stock dividends declared, by the average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding.The information used to compute basic and diluted EPS attributable to Arconic common shareholders was as follows (shares in millions):For the year ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Net income (loss)$470 $642 $(74)Less: preferred stock dividends declared(2) (2) (53)Net income (loss) available to Arconic common shareholders - basic468 640 (127)Add: interest expense related to convertible notes9 11 —Net income (loss) available to Arconic common shareholders - diluted$477 $651 $(127)Average shares outstanding - basic446 483 451Effect of dilutive securities:     Stock options1 1 —Stock and performance awards5 5 —Convertible notes(1)11 14 —Average shares outstanding - diluted463 503 451(1) The convertible notes matured on October 15, 2019 (see Note P). No shares of the Company’s common stock were issued in connection with the maturity or the final conversion of the convertible notes. As of October 15, 2019, the calculation of average diluted shares outstanding ceased to include the approximately 15 million shares of common stock and the corresponding interest expense previously attributable to the convertible notes.Common stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 433 million and 483 million, respectively. The decrease in common stock outstanding at December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the impact of share repurchases of approximately 55 million in 2019 (see Note H). As average shares outstanding are used in the calculation for both basic and diluted EPS, the full impact of share repurchases was not realized in EPS in 2019 as the share repurchases occurred at varying points during 2019.The following shares were excluded from the calculation of average shares outstanding – diluted as their effect was anti-dilutive (shares in millions). 2019 2018 2017Mandatory convertible preferred stockn/a n/a 39Convertible notes— — 14Stock options(1)1 9 11Stock awards— — 7(1) The average exercise price of options per share was $35.75, $26.79, and $33.32 for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.In 2017, had Arconic generated sufficient net income, 30 million, 14 million, 5 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options, respectively, would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding.

ReceivablesSale of Receivables ProgramArconic has an arrangement with three financial institutions to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis. The sale of such receivables is completed using a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Arconic. This arrangement provides up to a maximum funding of $400 for receivables sold. Arconic maintains a beneficial interest, or a right to collect cash, on the sold receivables that have not been funded (deferred purchase program). On March 30, 2012, Arconic initially sold $304 of customer receivables in exchange for $50 in cash and $254 of deferred purchase program under the arrangement. Arconic has received additional net cash funding of $300 ($3,558 in draws and $3,258 in repayments) since the program’s inception, including net cash draws totaling $0 ($600 in draws and $600 in repayments) in 2019 and net cash draws totaling $0 ($600 in draws and $600 in repayments) in 2018.As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the deferred purchase program receivable was $246 and $234, respectively, which was included in Other receivables on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase program receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase program receivable. The gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collected under this program since its inception was $48,383 and $47,787 respectively. Arconic services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded.In 2019 and 2018, the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase program receivable were $6,599 and $6,586 respectively, and $6,375 and $6,328, respectively. Cash receipts from customer payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have been previously sold in this program) as well as cash receipts and cash disbursements from draws and repayments under the program are presented as cash receipts from sold receivables within investing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.On January 2, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to remove subsidiaries of the GRP business from the sale of receivables program in preparation for the planned Separation of Arconic and repurchased the remaining $282 unpaid receivables of GRP customers in a non-cash transaction by reducing the amount of the deferred purchase program receivable.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe following table details the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to customer receivables and other receivables: Customer receivables Other receivables 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017Balance at beginning of year$4 $8 $13 $31 $34 $32Provision for doubtful accounts3 2 1 13 7 9Write off of uncollectible accounts(2) (2) (5) (2) (2) (1)Recoveries of prior write-offs— — — (5) (3) (3)Other(2) (4) (1) (4) (5) (3)Balance at end of year$3 $4 $8 $33 $31 $3492Table of ContentsL.

If valued on an average-cost basis, total inventories would have been $445 and $530 higher at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2019 and 2018, reductions in LIFO inventory quantities caused partial liquidations of the lower cost LIFO inventory base. These liquidations resulted in the recognition of immaterial income amounts in 2019, 2018, and 2017.In the second quarter of 2018, a charge of $23 was recorded in Cost of goods sold and Inventories to reflect a physical inventory adjustment at one plant in the GRP segment (this plant was previously included in the EP&F segment prior to the transfer of the aluminum extrusions operations from the EP&F segment to the GRP segment in the first quarter of 2019 - see Note C). While a portion of this charge relates to prior years, the majority relates to 2018. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual periods.M.

The carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the Disks asset group long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired. The impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the long-lived assets, with fair value determined using a DCF model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence. The impairment charge of $428 recorded in the second quarter of 2019 impacted properties, plants, and equipment; intangible assets; and certain other noncurrent assets by $198, $197, and $33, respectively. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2019.During the second quarter of 2018, the Company updated its three-year strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the Disks asset group within the EP&F segment. As such, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing their carrying value of approximately $515 to the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the Disks asset group, resulting in an estimated fair value in excess of their carrying value of 93Table of Contentsapproximately 13%; thus, there was no impairment. There were no indicators of impairment identified for the Disks asset group during the third or fourth quarters of 2018 and, as such, the Company did not evaluate the recoverability of its long-lived assets.N.

On October 15, 2019, the 1.63% Convertible Notes (""the Notes"") matured in accordance with their terms and the Company repaid in cash on the maturity date the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes of approximately $403 together with accrued and unpaid interest, pursuant to the terms of the Notes.During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the early redemption of its remaining outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019, with aggregate principal amount of $500, for $518 in cash including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $19 in Interest expense in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for 2018 primarily for the premium paid on the early redemption of these notes in excess of their carrying value.During the second quarter of 2017, the Company announced three separate cash tender offers by the Investment Banks for the purchase of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018 (the “6.50% Bonds”), 6.75% Notes due 2018 (the “6.75% Notes”), and 5.72% Notes due 2019 (the “5.72% Notes”), up to a maximum purchase amount of $1,000 aggregate principal amount of notes, subject to certain conditions. The Investment Banks purchased notes totaling $805 aggregate principal amount, including $150 aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Bonds, $405 aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Notes, and $250 aggregate principal amount of 5.72% Notes.Also, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company agreed to acquire the notes from the Investment Banks for $409 in cash plus its remaining investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock (12,958,767 shares valued at $35.91 per share) for total consideration of $874 including accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a charge of $58 ($27 in cash) primarily for the premium for the early redemption of the notes, a benefit of $8 for the proceeds of a related interest rate swap agreement, and a charge of $2 for legal fees associated with the transaction in Interest expense, and recorded a gain of $167 in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for the Debt-for-Equity Exchange.Finally, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the early redemption of its remaining outstanding 6.50% Bonds, with aggregate principal amount of $100, and its remaining outstanding 6.75% Notes, with aggregate principal amount of $345, for $479 in cash including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the early redemption of the 6.50% Bonds and 6.75% Notes, the Company recorded a charge of $24 in Interest expense in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for the premium paid for the early redemption of these notes in excess of their carrying value.The Company has the option to redeem certain of its Notes and Bonds in whole or part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, plus in either case accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.96Table of ContentsCredit Facilities. On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein, which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). By an Extension Request and Amendment Letter dated as of June 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to July 25, 2020. On September 16, 2016, Arconic entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement to permit the Separation of Alcoa and to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement, including the replacement of the existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. On June 29, 2018, Arconic entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment No. 2”) to amend and restate the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as so amended and restated, is herein referred to as the “Credit Agreement.”The Credit Agreement provides a $3,000 Credit Facility, the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Arconic. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sublimit of $1,000 of the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Arconic shall not permit the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, to be greater than 4.50 to 1.00, which maximum level will step down successively to 4.00 to 1.00 on December 31, 2018, and to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter.The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconic’s ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Arconic’s ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconic’s ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2019, Arconic was in compliance with all such covenants.The Credit Facility matures on June 29, 2023, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Arconic may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will pay a fee of 0.25% per annum (based on Arconic’s current long-term debt ratings) of the total commitment to maintain the Credit Facility.The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.50% and 1.50% per annum, respectively, based on Arconic’s current long-term debt ratings. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.The obligation of Arconic to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) non-payment of obligations; (b) breach of any representation or warranty in any material respect; (c) non-performance of covenants and obligations; (d) with respect to other indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million, a default thereunder that causes such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity or a default in the payment at maturity of any principal of such indebtedness; (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic; and (f) a change in control of Arconic.There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 and no amounts were borrowed during 2019, 2018, or 2017 under the Credit Facility.In addition to the Credit Agreement above, Arconic has a number of other credit agreements that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $640 as of December 31, 2019, all of which is due to expire in 2020. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, Arconic borrowed and repaid $400, $600, and $810, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2019, 2018, and 2017 were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 2.6%, respectively, and 49 days, 46 days, and 46 days, respectively.Short-Term Debt. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, short-term debt was $31 and $29, respectively. These amounts included $29 and $29 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to accounts payable settlement arrangements with certain vendors and third-party intermediaries. These arrangements provide that, at the vendor’s request, the third-party intermediary advances the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropriate discount, before the scheduled payment date and Arconic makes payment to the third-party intermediary on the date stipulated in accordance with the commercial terms negotiated with its vendors. Arconic records imputed interest related to these arrangements in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.97Table of ContentsCommercial Paper. Arconic had no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2019 and 2018. In 2019, Arconic did not issue commercial paper. In 2018, the average outstanding commercial paper was $49. Commercial paper matures at various times within one year and had an annual weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during 2018.Q. Other Financial InstrumentsFair Value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (ii) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:•Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Derivatives, Noncurrent receivables, and Short-term debt included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair value. The Company holds exchange-traded fixed income securities which are considered available-for-sale securities that are carried at fair value which is based on quoted market prices which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of Long-term debt, less amount due within one year was based on quoted market prices for public debt and on interest rates that are currently available to Arconic for issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities for non-public debt. The fair value amounts for all Long-term debt were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 2019 2018December 31,Carryingvalue Fairvalue Carryingvalue FairvalueLong-term debt, less amount due within one year$4,906 $5,337 $5,896 $5,873Restricted cash was $55 (see Note S), $6, and $4 in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.R.

On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction (see Note H).In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks for the remaining portion of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest (see Note P).S. Acquisitions and Divestitures2019 Divestitures. On May 31, 2019, Arconic sold a small additive manufacturing facility within the EP&F segment for $1 in cash, which resulted in a loss of $13 recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The sale is subject to certain post-closing adjustments.98Table of ContentsOn August 15, 2019, Arconic sold inventories and properties, plants, and equipment related to a small energy business within the EP&F segment for $13 in cash. Arconic recognized a charge of $10 related to inventory impairment and recorded the charge in Cost of goods sold in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.On October 30, 2019, Arconic reached an agreement to sell its hard alloy extrusions plant in South Korea for $61 in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The operating results and assets and liabilities of this plant are included in the GRP segment. The sale transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Arconic expects to recognize a gain of $25 to $30 upon the sale, which will be recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.On December 1, 2019, Arconic completed the sale of its forgings business in the United Kingdom for $64 in cash, which resulted in a loss on sale of $46 which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Of the cash proceeds received, $53 was recorded as Restricted cash within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 as its use is subject to restriction by the U.K. pension authority until certain U.K. pension plan changes have been made and approved. The forgings business primarily produces steel, titanium, and nickel based forged components for aerospace, mining, and off-highway markets and its operating results and assets and liabilities are included in the EP&F segment. The sale remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments. This business generated sales of $116, $131, and $127 in 2019, 2018, and 2017, and had 540 employees at the time of divestiture.On February 1, 2020, Arconic sold its aluminum rolling mill in Itapissuma, Brazil for $50 in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The rolling mill produces specialty foil and sheet products and its operating results and assets and liabilities were included in the GRP segment. As a result of entering into the agreement to sell in August 2019, Arconic recognized a charge of $53 in 2019 related to a non-cash impairment of the net book value of the business, primarily properties, plants, and equipment. This charge was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. This business generated sales of $143, $179, and $162 in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively, and had 513 employees at the time of divestiture.2018 Divestitures. On April 2, 2018, Arconic completed the sale of the Latin America extrusions business to a subsidiary of Hydro Extruded Solutions AS for $2, following the settlement of post-closing and other adjustments in December 2018. As a result of entering into the agreement to sell the Latin America extrusions business in December 2017, a charge of $41 was recognized in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations related to the non-cash impairment of the net book value of the business and an additional charge of $2 related to a post-closing adjustment was recorded in 2018. The operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the TCS segment at the time of divestiture, but were transferred to Corporate in connection with a segment change (see Note B). This business generated sales of $25 and $115 in 2018 and 2017 and had 612 employees at the time of divestiture.On July 31, 2018, the Company announced that it had initiated a sale process of BCS, as part of the Company’s then ongoing strategy and portfolio review. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company decided to no longer pursue the sale of BCS.On October 31, 2018, the Company sold its Texarkana, Texas rolling mill and cast house, which had a combined net book value of $63, to Ta Chen International, Inc. for $302 in cash, including the settlement of post-closing adjustments, plus additional contingent consideration of up to $50. The contingent consideration relates to the achievement of various milestones within 36 months of the transaction closing date associated with operationalizing the rolling mill equipment. The operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the GRP segment. The Texarkana rolling mill facility had previously been idle since late 2009. In early 2016, the Company restarted the Texarkana cast house to meet demand for aluminum slab. As part of the agreement, the Company will continue to produce aluminum slab at the facility for a period of 18 months through a lease back of the cast house building and equipment, after which time, Ta Chen may perform toll processing of metal for the Company for a period of six months. The Company will supply Ta Chen with cold-rolled aluminum coil during this 24-month period.The sale of the rolling mill and cast house had been accounted for separately. The gain on the sale of the rolling mill of $154, including the fair value of contingent consideration of $5 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company received additional contingent consideration of $20 and recorded a gain. These amounts were recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Company continues to reevaluate its estimate of the remaining $25 of contingent consideration to which it will be entitled at the end of each reporting period and will recognize any changes thereto in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.The Company had continuing involvement related to the lease back of the cast house. As a result, in 2018, the Company continued to treat the cast house building and equipment that it sold to Ta Chen as owned and therefore reflected the following balances in its Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018: assets of $24 in Properties, plants, and equipment, net; cash proceeds of $119 in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits (which included a deferred gain of $95); and a deferred tax asset of $22 in Other noncurrent assets. In conjunction with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (see Note A), the Company's continuing involvement no longer requires deferral of the recognition of the cast house sale. As such, the cash 99Table of Contentsproceeds, fixed assets, and deferred tax asset related to the cast house were reclassified to Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.On December 31, 2018, as part of the Company’s then ongoing strategy and portfolio review, Arconic completed the sale of its forgings business in Hungary to Angstrom Automotive Group LLC for $2, which resulted in a loss of $43 recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the EP&F segment. This business generated sales of $32 and $38 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and had 180 employees at the time of the divestiture.2017 Divestitures. In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its rolling mill in Italy to Slim Aluminium. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill were included in the GRP segment. As part of the transaction, Arconic injected $10 of cash into the business and provided a third-party guarantee with a fair value of $5 related to Slim Aluminium’s environmental remediation. The Company recorded a loss on the sale of $60, which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations in 2017. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $54 in 2017 and had approximately 312 employees.2014 Acquisitions. In November 2014, Arconic acquired Firth Rixson. The purchase price included an earn-out agreement that required Arconic to make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through December 31, 2020 upon certain conditions. This earn-out was contingent on the Firth Rixson forgings business in Savannah, Georgia achieving certain identified financial targets through December 31, 2020. During 2016, management determined that payment of the maximum amount was not probable based on the forecasted financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $56 with a corresponding credit to Other expense (income), net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. During 2017, management determined that payment of the remaining amount of the contingent liability was not probable based on the forecasted financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $81 to zero at December 31, 2017 with a corresponding credit to Other expense (income), net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The fair value of this liability has remained at zero at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 based on the forecasted financial performance of this location.T. Contingencies and CommitmentsContingenciesEnvironmental Matters. Arconic participates in environmental assessments and cleanups at more than 100 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites.A liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs. The liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, and technological changes, among others.Arconic’s remediation reserve balance was $230 at December 31, 2019 and $266 at December 31, 2018 recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (of which $94 and $81, respectively, were classified as a current liability), and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. Payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were $65 in 2019 and $32 in 2018 and included expenditures currently mandated, as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party. The higher payments in 2019 compared with 2018 reflect the start of construction related to the Grasse River project. Arconic expects that trend to continue for 2020 as reflected by the increase in the portion of the reserve that is considered a current liability.Included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs. These costs are estimated to be approximately 1% or less of Cost of goods sold.The following discussion provides details regarding the current status of the most significant remediation reserves related to a current Arconic site.Massena West, NY—Arconic has an ongoing remediation project related to the Grasse River, which is adjacent to Arconic’s Massena plant site. Many years ago, it was determined that sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The project, which was selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a Record of Decision issued in April 2013, is aimed at capping PCB contaminated sediments with concentration in excess of one part per million in the main channel of the river and dredging PCB contaminated sediments in the near-shore areas where total PCBs exceed one part per million. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the reserve balances associated with this matter were $171 and $198, respectively. In the first quarter of 2019, Arconic received approval from the EPA of its final remedial design which 100Table of Contentsis now under construction and is expected to be completed in 2022. During the second quarter of 2019, Arconic recorded a charge of $25 due to changes required in the remedial design and post-construction monitoring. As the project proceeds, the liability may be updated due to factors such as changes in remedial requirements, site restoration costs, and ongoing operation and maintenance costs, among others.Tax. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation of Alcoa, the Company shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation for, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the Company with respect to the following matter.As previously reported, in July 2013, following a Spanish corporate income tax audit covering the 2006 through 2009 tax years, an assessment was received mainly disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. Arconic filed another appeal in Spain’s National Court in March 2015 which was denied in July 2018. The National Court’s decision requires the assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years to be reissued to take into account the outcome of the 2003 to 2005 audit which was closed in 2017. The Company estimates the revised assessment to be $172 (€154), including interest.In March 2019, the Supreme Court of Spain accepted the Company's petition to review the National Court’s decision, and the Company has filed a formal appeal of the assessment. The Supreme Court is reviewing the assessment on its merits and will render a final decision. In the event the Company receives an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court of Spain, a portion of the assessment may be offset with existing net operating losses and tax credits available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement.In the third quarter of 2018, Arconic established an income tax reserve and an indemnification receivable representing Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of the liability. As of the end of 2019, the balances of the reserve, including interest, and the receivable are $59 million (€53 million) and $29 million (€26 million), respectively.Additionally, while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit, it is possible that the Company may receive assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013. Any potential assessment for an individual tax year is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated operations.Reynobond PE. As previously reported, on June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, U.K. caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic, Arconic Architectural Products SAS (AAP SAS), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metropolitan Police Service (the “Police”), a Public Inquiry by the British government and a consumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. The Public Inquiry was announced by the U.K. Prime Minister on June 15, 2017 and subsequently was authorized to examine the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the Grenfell Tower fire in order to make findings of fact and recommendations to the U.K. Government on matters such as the design, construction and modification of the building, the role of relevant public authorities and contractors, the implications of the fire for the adequacy and enforcement of relevant regulations, arrangements in place for handling emergencies and the handling of concerns from residents, among other things. Hearings for Phase 1 of the Public Inquiry began on May 21, 2018 and concluded on December 12, 2018. Phase 2 hearings of the Public Inquiry began in early 2020, following which a final report will be written and subsequently published. AAP SAS is participating as a Core Participant in the Public Inquiry and is also cooperating with the ongoing parallel investigation by the Police. The Company no longer sells the PE product for architectural use on buildings. Given the preliminary nature of these investigations and the uncertainty of potential future litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome.Behrens et al. v. Arconic Inc. et al. As previously reported, on June 6, 2019, 247 plaintiffs comprised of survivors and estates of decedents of the Grenfell Tower fire filed a complaint against “Arconic Inc., Alcoa Inc. and Arconic Architectural Products, LLC” (collectively, for purposes of the description of such proceeding, the “Arconic Defendants”), as well as Saint-Gobain Corporation, d/b/a Celotex and Whirlpool Corporation, in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The complaint alleges claims under Pennsylvania state law for products liability and wrongful death related to the fire. In particular, the plaintiffs allege that the Arconic Defendants knowingly supplied a dangerous product (Reynobond PE) for installation on the Grenfell Tower despite knowing that Reynobond PE was unfit for use above a certain height. The Arconic Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on June 19, 2019. On August 29, 2019, the Arconic Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the bases, among other things, that: (i) the case should be heard in the United Kingdom, not the United States; (ii) there is no jurisdiction over necessary parties; and (iii) Pennsylvania products 101Table of Contentsliability law does not apply to manufacture and sale of product overseas. On December 23, 2019, the Court issued an order denying the motion to dismiss the complaint on bases (ii) and (iii) and suggesting a procedure for limited discovery followed by further briefing on those subjects. Discovery is ongoing on defendants’ motion to have the case dismissed in favor of a UK forum (forum non conveniens). On January 23, 2020, the Court ordered that the parties complete discovery relating to forum non conveniens by March 16, 2020, and that briefing conclude on April 13, 2020. The Court will hold oral argument on this motion on May 7, 2020. Given the preliminary nature of this matter and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome.Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al. As previously reported, a purported class action complaint related to the Grenfell Tower fire was filed on August 11, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Arconic Inc. and Klaus Kleinfeld. A related purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on September 15, 2017, under the caption Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al., against Arconic Inc., three former Arconic executives, several current and former Arconic directors, and banks that acted as underwriters for Arconic’s September 18, 2014 preferred stock offering (the “Preferred Offering”). The plaintiff in Sullivan had previously filed a purported class action against the same defendants on July 18, 2017 in the Southern District of New York and, on August 25, 2017, voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice. On February 7, 2018, on motion from certain putative class members, the court consolidated Howard and Sullivan, closed Sullivan, and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case. On April 9, 2018, the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated purported class action filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleged that the registration statement for the Preferred Offering contained false and misleading statements and omitted to state material information, including by allegedly failing to disclose material uncertainties and trends resulting from sales of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses and by allegedly expressing a belief that appropriate risk management and compliance programs had been adopted while concealing the risks posed by Reynobond PE sales. The consolidated amended complaint also alleged that between November 4, 2013 and June 23, 2017 Arconic and Kleinfeld made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information about the Company’s commitment to safety, business and financial prospects, and the risks of the Reynobond PE product, including in Arconic’s Form 10-Ks for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, its Form 10-Qs and quarterly financial press releases from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2017, its 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Annual Reports, its 2016 Annual Highlights Report, and on its official website. The consolidated amended complaint sought, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On June 8, 2018, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint for failure to state a claim. On June 21, 2019, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss in full, dismissing the consolidated amended complaint in its entirety without prejudice. On July 23, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint alleges generally the same claims as the consolidated amended complaint with certain additional allegations, as well as claims that the risk factors set forth in the registration statement for the Preferred Offering were inadequate and that certain additional statements in the sources identified above were misleading. The second amended complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On September 11, 2019, all defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. Plaintiffs’ opposition to that motion was filed by November 1, 2019 and all defendants filed a reply brief on November 26, 2019. Given the preliminary nature of this matter and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome.Raul v. Albaugh, et al. As previously reported, on June 22, 2018, a derivative complaint was filed nominally on behalf of Arconic by a purported Arconic stockholder against the then members of Arconic’s Board of Directors and Klaus Kleinfeld and Ken Giacobbe, naming Arconic as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint raises similar allegations as the consolidated amended complaint and second amended complaint in Howard, as well as allegations that the defendants improperly authorized the sale of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses, and asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Delaware state law. On July 13, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to stay this case until the final resolution of the Howard case, the Grenfell Tower Public Inquiry in London, and the investigation by the Police and on July 23, 2018, the Court approved the stay. Given the preliminary nature of this matter and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome.While the Company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters.Stockholder Demands. As previously noted, the Board of Directors also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of stockholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board authorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board and others. The Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee of the Board to review, investigate, and make recommendations to the Board regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to these stockholder demand letters. On May 22, 2019, the Special Litigation 102Table of ContentsCommittee, following completion of its investigation into the claims demanded in the demand letters, recommended to the Board that it reject the demands to authorize commencement of litigation. On May 28, 2019, the Board adopted the Special Litigation Committee’s findings and recommendations and rejected the demands that it authorize commencement of actions to assert the claims set forth in the demand letters.Other. In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, tax and antitrust matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.CommitmentsPurchase Obligations. Arconic has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, energy and other goods and services, which total $604 in 2020, $93 in 2021, $45 in 2022, $12 in 2023, $4 in 2024, and $2 thereafter.Operating Leases. See Note O for the operating lease future minimum contractual obligations.Guarantees. At December 31, 2019, Arconic had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2020 and 2040 was $31 at December 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $9 and $6 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Furthermore, Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant Generation Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee. For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,353 and $1,087 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. This guarantee expires in 2047. For this guarantee, subject to its provisions, Arconic is secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation. Arconic currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote. In December 2019, Arconic entered into a one-year insurance policy with a limit of $80 relating to the remaining long-term energy supply agreement. The premium is expected to be paid by Alcoa Corporation. The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement or insurance policy will be made on an annual basis going forward.Letters of Credit. Arconic has outstanding letters of credit, primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2020, was $142 at December 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $52 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.Surety Bonds. Arconic has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these surety bonds, which expire at various dates, primarily in 2020, was $50 at December 31, 2019.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $24 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionately billed to and that portion billed is being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.103Table of ContentsU. Separation Transactions2019 Proposed Separation Transaction. On February 8, 2019, Arconic announced, as part of its strategy and portfolio review, a separation of its portfolio into two independent, publicly-traded companies (the ""Separation of Arconic""). The EP&F segment will remain in the existing company (Remain Co.) which will be renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. at separation. The GRP segment will comprise Spin Co. and will be named Arconic Corporation at separation. The Company has also executed on the sale of businesses that do not best fit into the EP&F and GRP segments. The Company is targeting to complete the Separation of Arconic on April 1, 2020. The Separation of Arconic remains subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and may change if certain conditions are not satisfied by that date, as described in Arconic Rolled Products Corporation’s (“Arconic Corporation”) information statement filed with the Form 10. On February 5, 2020, Arconic’s Board of Directors approved the completion of the separation by means of a pro rata distribution (the “Distribution”) by the Company of all of the outstanding common stock of Arconic Corporation. To consummate the separation and the Distribution, the Board declared a pro rata distribution of Arconic Corporation common stock, which is expected to be effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on April 1, 2020, to Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the “Record Date”). In the Distribution, each Company stockholder will receive one share of Arconic Corporation common stock for every four shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. Stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Arconic Corporation common stock.Timothy D. Myers will serve as Arconic Corporation Chief Executive Officer.  Arconic’s Board of Directors has also named new directors to the Arconic Corporation and Howmet Aerospace Boards.  Joining the Arconic Corporation Board of Directors will be: Timothy Myers; William Austen; Christopher Ayers; Margaret Billson; Austin Camporin; Jacques Croisetiere; Elmer Doty; Carol Eicher; Fritz Henderson; E. Stanley O’Neal; and Jeffrey Stafeil.  Christopher Ayers, Elmer Doty and Stanley O’Neal will resign from the Arconic Inc. Board of Directors.  Joining the Howmet Aerospace Board of Directors will be: Joseph Cantie; Robert Leduc; Jody Miller; and Nicole Piasecki.On February 7, 2020, the Company announced that Arconic Rolled Products Corporation (the “Issuer”), which is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arconic, closed its offering of $600 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% second-lien notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the offering to make a payment to Arconic to fund the transfer of certain assets from Arconic to the Issuer in connection with the Separation of Arconic and for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the offering will be held in escrow until the completion of the separation and the satisfaction of certain other escrow release conditions. Prior to the separation, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Following the separation, the Notes will be guaranteed by certain of the Issuer’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. Each of the Notes and the related guarantees will be secured on a second-priority basis by liens on certain assets of the Issuer and the guarantors.On February 13, 2020, the Form 10 for Arconic Rolled Products Corporation was declared effective by the SEC. In 2019, Arconic recognized $78 in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for costs related to the Separation of Arconic.2016 Separation Transaction. The separation of Alcoa Inc. into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation, became effective on November 1, 2016 (the “Separation of Alcoa”). As part of the Separation of Alcoa, Arconic retained 19.9% of the Alcoa Corporation common stock (36,311,767 shares). In February 2017, Arconic sold 23,353,000 of its shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock at $38.03 per share, which resulted in cash proceeds of $888 which were recorded in Sales of investments within Investing Activities in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, and a gain of $351 which was recorded in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. In April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the “Investment Banks”) in exchange for cash and the Company’s remaining 12,958,767 Alcoa Corporation shares (valued at $35.91 per share) (the “Debt-for-Equity Exchange”) (See Note P). A gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange was recorded in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of May 4, 2017, the Company no longer maintained a retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock.As part of the Separation of Alcoa, Arconic was required to provide maximum potential future payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, guarantees related to two long-term Alcoa Corporation energy supply agreements, guarantees related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities and energy supply contracts, letters of credit and surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016, and letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts (see Note T).As part of the Separation of Alcoa, Arconic received proceeds of $243 in 2017 related to Alcoa Corporation’s sale of its Yadkin Hydroelectric Project, which were included in Other within Investing Activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.During 2017, Arconic recognized $18 ($12 after-tax) in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for costs related to the Separation of Alcoa.104Table of ContentsV. Subsequent EventsManagement evaluated all activity of Arconic and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, except as noted below:See Note K for details of an amendment to remove GRP from the sale of receivables program.See Note S for details of the divestiture of the Company's aluminum rolling mill in Itapissuma, Brazil.See Note U for updates on the planned Separation of Arconic.On February 25, 2020, the Company announced that its current Chief Executive Officer, John C. Plant, and Tolga Oal, who currently serves as President of the Company’s Engineered Structures business unit, will serve as Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company following the Separation of Arconic.  Until the Separation of Arconic, Mr. Plant will continue to serve as sole Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Oal will hold the title of Co-Chief Executive Officer Designate.  Mr. Plant will serve as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Howmet Aerospace following the Separation of Arconic.105Table of ContentsSupplemental Financial Information (unaudited)Quarterly Data(in millions, except per-share amounts)  FirstSecond(2)ThirdFourth(3)Year2019     Sales$3,541$3,691$3,559$3,401$14,192Net income (loss)$187$(121)$95$309$470Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Arconic common shareholders(1):     Basic     Net income (loss) per share—basic$0.40$(0.27)$0.22$0.71$1.05Diluted     Net income (loss) per share—diluted$0.39$(0.27)$0.21$0.70$1.032018     Sales$3,445$3,573$3,524$3,472$14,014Net income$143$120$161$218$642Earnings per share attributable to Arconic common shareholders(1):     Basic     Net income per share—basic$0.30$0.25$0.33$0.45$1.33Diluted     Net income per share—basic$0.29$0.24$0.32$0.44$1.30(1) Per share amounts are calculated independently for each period presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal the per share amounts for the year.(2) In the second quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $428 related to its disks business (see Note M).(3) In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company incurred costs associated with the planned Separation of Arconic of $28 ($34 pre-tax), recorded a gain for contingent consideration received related to the 2018 sale of the Texarkana rolling mill of $15 ($20 pre-tax), and recorded several discrete tax items principally related to a benefit for a U.S. tax election which caused the deemed liquidation of a foreign subsidiary’s assets into its U.S. tax parent. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Arconic recorded a gain of $119 ($154 pre-tax) on the sale of the Texarkana rolling mill, offset by pension plan settlement charges of $72 ($92 pre-tax) associated with significant lump sum payments made to participants and a loss of $39 ($43 pre-tax) on the sale of the forging business in Hungary.

7,,">Item 1A. Risk Factors. Arconic’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing Arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Arconic or that Arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company in future periods.The markets for Arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.Arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation and construction industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control.In particular, Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies, the ability of 14Table of Contentsaircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators, the retirement of older aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines.Further, the demand for Arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive manufacturers and Arconic content per vehicle. The automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions, including credit markets and interest rates, and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage, vehicle size, configuration and features. Automotive sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and levels of competition.While Arconic believes that the long-term prospects for its products are positive, the Company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government intervention. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.As discussed in Part I, Item 1. (Business-Competitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for Arconic’s products are highly competitive. Arconic’s competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. New product offerings, new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace Arconic products. The willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Arconic, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for Arconic’s products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Arconic’s competitors or customers could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, Arconic may face increased competition due to industry consolidation. As companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of Arconic’s business may acquire or form alliances with Arconic’s competitors, thereby reducing their business with Arconic. Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. If there is consolidation among Arconic’s customer base, those customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect Arconic’s profitability. Moreover, if, as a result of increased leverage, customer pressures require Arconic to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished, the Company could decide not to sell certain products under such less favorable terms, which would decrease Arconic’s revenue. Consolidation among the Company’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for Arconic’s solutions, replacement of Arconic products by the combined entity with those of Arconic’s competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, operating results and financial condition.Arconic may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully.Arconic’s competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to:•identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in Arconic’s target end-markets;•identify and successfully execute on a strategy to remain an essential and sustainable element of its customer’s supply chain; •fund, develop, manufacture and bring innovative new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively;•monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers’ and competitors’ abilities to deploy those disruptive technologies; and•achieve sufficient return on investment for new products based on capital expenditures and research and development spending.Arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments, including additive manufacturing, alloy development, engineered finishes and product design, high speed continuous casting and rolling technology, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. For more information on Arconic’s research and development programs, see “Research and Development” in Part I, Item 1. (Business-Research and Development) of this report.15Table of ContentsWhile Arconic intends to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors, including those developing technology to displace Arconic’s current products. In addition, Arconic may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages. There can be no assurance that any of Arconic’s new products or services, development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or beneficial to Arconic.Arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers.A significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer or customers supplied by Arconic could affect Arconic’s financial results in a particular period. Arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their businesses. Arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Arconic, including to reduce the amount of Arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers. If Arconic is unsuccessful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected.Arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety, which could affect Arconic’s reputation, business and financial statements.The manufacture of many of Arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols, specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, problems with raw materials, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, labor unrest and environmental factors. Such problems could have an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product quality or performance. Product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure, including if any of our products are non-compliant or are used in an unintended and/or unapproved manner that results in injuries or other damages. Because of approval and license requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to the Company or its customers. Accordingly, manufacturing problems, product defects or other risks associated with our products, including their use or application, could result in significant costs to and liability for Arconic that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations, including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages, fines or penalties, as well as negative publicity and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Arconic’s business depends, in part, on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations, reductions and delays.Arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation, military aircraft and aircraft engine programs and is the sole supplier of aluminum sheet for a number of aluminum-intensive automotive vehicle programs. Many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years. If Arconic fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, program cancellations, reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business.Arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending.Arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft and armored vehicles. Although many of the programs in which Arconic participates extend several years, they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations. Changes in military strategy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for Arconic’s products, which could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic’s global operations and status as a public company expose the Company to risks that could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the market price of its securities.Arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia. As a result, the Company’s global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which Arconic does business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, including:•economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings;16Table of Contents•geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements;•war or terrorist activities;•kidnapping of personnel;•major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, or the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Arconic’s operations or workforce;•difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; •changes in trade and tax laws that may result in our customers being subjected to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and reduce their willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products;•rising labor costs;•labor unrest, including strikes;•compliance with antitrust and competition regulations; •compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. laws;•aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by national governmental authorities;•compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-bribery and corruption laws;•compliance with U.S. laws concerning trade, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (“OFAC”); •imposition of currency controls;•adverse tax audit rulings; and•unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.Although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. While Arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management, compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the risks associated with these factors, such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs or liabilities that may arise from such events. As a public company, Arconic is subject to, among other things, the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. Arconic’s failure to comply with applicable law could subject it to penalties under federal securities laws, expose it to lawsuits and restrict its ability to access financing. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Arconic must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Arconic’s internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which the Company had previously believed that internal controls were effective. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could result in adverse regulatory consequences and/or a loss of investor confidence, which could limit the Company’s ability to access the global capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or the market price of Arconic securities. A material disruption of Arconic’s operations, particularly at one or more of the Company’s manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect Arconic’s business.If Arconic’s operations, particularly one of the Company’s manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, theft, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes or other reasons, the Company may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers, which could adversely affect Arconic’s financial performance.Interruptions in production could increase the Company’s costs and reduce its sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect Arconic’s profitability and financial condition. Arconic maintains property damage insurance that the Company believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under Arconic’s insurance policies may not offset the lost profits or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect Arconic’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.17Table of ContentsArconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business and competitive position.Arconic owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining Arconic’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Arconic’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Arconic’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents Arconic owns or licenses. The pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of Arconic intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. Further, as the Company expands its operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of Arconic intellectual property increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against Arconic relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce Arconic’s rights sufficiently, could adversely affect Arconic’s business and competitive position.Arconic may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic alliances.Arconic has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio. Although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to Arconic, there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company, unanticipated costs and liabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. The Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. Additionally, adverse factors may prevent Arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines.With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, Arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from customers, suppliers, unions, local or national governments, or other stakeholders. In addition, Arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Arconic’s business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures.In addition, Arconic has participated in, and may continue to participate in, joint ventures, strategic alliances and other similar arrangements from time to time. Although the Company has, in connection with past and existing joint ventures, sought to protect its interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not Arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may:•have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Company;•exercise veto rights to block actions that Arconic believes to be in its or the joint venture’s or strategic alliance’s best interests; •take action contrary to Arconic’s policies or objectives with respect to investments; or•as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.There can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures, closures, joint ventures, strategic alliances or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to Arconic, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other factors.Arconic may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business segments, or complete projects, at the levels, projected costs or by the dates targeted.From time to time, Arconic may announce future targets or goals for its business, which are based on the Company’s then current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which Arconic operates. Future targets and goals reflect the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends, then current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. As such, targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. The actual outcome may be materially different. There can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the Company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all. Failure to achieve the targets or goals by the Company may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.18Table of ContentsIn addition, the implementation of Arconic’s business strategy periodically involves the entry into and the execution of complex projects, which place significant demands on the Company’s management and personnel, and may depend on numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. There can be no assurance that such projects will be completed within budgeted costs, on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to the risks described in this report, or other factors. The failure to complete a material project as planned, or a significant delay in a material project, whatever the cause, could have an adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.Arconic’s plans to restructure the Company, including separating into two companies and the possible sales of businesses, will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect Arconic’s business, may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits, are subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timelines, or at all.On February 8, 2019, Arconic announced plans to separate into Engineered Products & Forgings and Global Rolled Products, with a spin-off of one of the businesses, and to consider the possible sales of certain businesses. Arconic expects that the process of completing the proposed separation and possible sales of businesses will be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what it currently anticipates and may not yield a benefit if the separation and/or sales are not completed. Executing these transactions will also require significant time and attention from Arconic’s senior management and employees, which could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and adversely affect financial results and results of operations. Arconic may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees or maintaining or initiating relationships with lead suppliers, customers and other parties with which Arconic currently does business, or may do business in the future, during the pendency of the separation and/or possible sales of businesses and following their completion, which could have a material and adverse effect on Arconic’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the independent companies resulting from the separation.Arconic may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the separation and/or possible sales of businesses. For example, as independent companies, the Engineered Products & Forgings and Global Rolled Products businesses will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, such as changes in industry conditions, which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows, working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, following the separation, there can be no assurance that either company will be able to obtain an investment grade rating from nationally recognized credit rating agencies, which could, among other things, increase the non-investment grade rated company’s cost of capital. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of Arconic’s common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred. In addition, if Arconic pursues the possible sales of businesses, it may face barriers to exit or objections from various stakeholders, and/or may retain liabilities for divested entities. There can be no assurance that any such sales will be undertaken or completed or that they will be beneficial to Arconic, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other factors.Additionally, the separation is subject to approval by Arconic’s Board of Directors and market, regulatory and certain other conditions. Unanticipated developments, including, among others, failure of the separation to qualify for the expected tax treatment, the possibility that any third-party consents required in connection with the separation will not be received, material adverse changes in business or industry conditions, changes in global economic and financial market conditions generally, and the ability to complete the possible sales of businesses, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation, or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected.Information technology system failures, cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Arconic’s intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Arconic relies on its information technology systems to manage and operate its business, process transactions, and summarize its operating results. Arconic’s information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by employees. If Arconic’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and Arconic may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material disruption in the Company’s information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new 19Table of Contentssystems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic also faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. The Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Arconic’s financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Arconic employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks, including technical security controls, data encryption, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, anti-virus software and frequent backups. Additionally, the Company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and result in the diminution of the value of the Company’s investment in research and development.Arconic’s enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from cyber attacks and security breaches. Arconic also maintains compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber attack or security breach. However, a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around the Company’s cybersecurity environment may prevent Arconic from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or the market price of its securities.A decline in Arconic’s financial performance or outlook could negatively impact the Company’s access to the global capital markets, reduce the Company’s liquidity and increase its borrowing costs.Arconic has significant capital requirements and depends, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic acquisitions. A decline in the Company’s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors could affect the Company’s access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that Arconic will have access to the global capital market on terms the Company finds acceptable. Limitations on Arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in the Company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.A downgrade of Arconic’s credit ratings could limit Arconic’s ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of its securities, trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.Arconic’s credit ratings are important to the Company’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate Arconic’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to the Company. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3. On February 7, 2019, S&P changed the outlook from stable to negative credit watch. On October 8, 2018, Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at Ba2, a non-investment grade, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt rating at Speculative Grade Liquidity-2. On September 27, 2018, Fitch affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the outlook from stable to positive.There can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to Arconic’s ratings. Increased debt levels, macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Company’s debt protection metrics, 20Table of Contentsa contraction in the Company’s liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.A downgrade of Arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of Arconic’s securities; adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by S&P or Moody’s would subject Arconic to higher costs under Arconic’s Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities); limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs; increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities; result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Arconic; or otherwise impair Arconic’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.Arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.Arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Arconic’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Arconic’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Company’s position in relation to its competitors.An adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect Arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.Arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. Arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity. For a discussion regarding how Arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7. (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Arconic would contribute to the pension plans.Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) was signed into law. HATFA extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law. BBA 2015 extends the relief period provided by HAFTA. Arconic believes that the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Company’s U.S. pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Company’s cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Company’s liabilities related to such plans, which could adversely affect Arconic’s liquidity and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in Arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Arconic’s future profitability.Arconic is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive 21Table of Contentseffect, could affect the Company’s tax expense and profitability. Arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.Corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. In particular, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) was signed into law, significantly reforming the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 Act. Those guidance projects, which include both Proposed and Final Treasury Regulations, will continue into 2019. The Company continues to review the components of the 2017 Act, as well as the ongoing interpretive guidance, and evaluate its consequences. As such, the ultimate impact of the 2017 Act may differ from reported amounts due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made to date; and actions the Company may take as a result of the 2017 Act and related guidance. These changes to the U.S. corporate tax system could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on Arconic’s future effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.Arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum.Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminum-based products. The price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable. Although the Company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the Company’s customers or is otherwise hedged, there are situations where Arconic is unable to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there is a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the Company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers and/or there are other timing factors that may result in Arconic's exposure to certain price fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, economic factors, and currency controls in the countries in which it operates.Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which Arconic operates, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect Arconic’s revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, including the Euro, British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and Russian ruble, may affect Arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while the Company’s products are generally sold in U.S. dollars.In addition, a portion of Arconic’s indebtedness, including certain borrowings under the Company’s Five-Year Credit Facility, bears interest at rates equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Accordingly, the Company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. Further, LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include changes in the cost of Arconic’s variable rate indebtedness.Arconic also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the Company’s ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by Arconic’s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. While Arconic currently has no need, and does not intend, to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, should the Company need to do so to fund its operations, it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs. Arconic currently has substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including China, and, if the Company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on Arconic’s operating results and financial condition.Arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.Arconic has undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including deployment of company-wide business process models, such as Arconic’s degrees of 22Table of Contentsimplementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and operating cost reductions, including, among others, those announced on February 8, 2019, in connection with the Company’s ongoing strategic and portfolio review. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to Arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. If Arconic fails to achieve net cost savings at anticipated levels, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.Arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials.Certain applications of Arconic’s aluminum-based products compete with products made from other materials, such as steel, titanium and composites. The willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes. For example, the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum, such as titanium and composites, in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft. Additionally, the automotive industry, while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum, may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications. Further, the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices. The willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of Arconic’s products, and thus adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic’s profitability could be adversely affected by volatility in the availability or cost of raw materials.Arconic’s results of operations may be affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials (including, but not limited to, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, titanium sponge and vanadium), as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions, changes in world politics or regulatory requirements, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, sanctions, new or increased import duties, countervailing or anti-dumping duties, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. In addition, from time to time, commodity prices may fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve, which may cause periodic supply interruptions. Arconic may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s operating results.Union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.A significant portion of Arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see “Employees” in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report. While Arconic previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions, Arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Arconic’s facilities in the future. Arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.A failure to attract, retain or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect Arconic’s operations and competitiveness.Arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience. The inability of the Company to attract and retain such people may adversely impact Arconic’s ability to meet project demands adequately and fill roles in existing operations. Skills shortages in engineering, manufacturing, technology, construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities. These shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations.In addition, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the Company’s growth and business strategy. The loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm Arconic’s business, and any unplanned turnover, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions, could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base, delay or impede the execution of the Company’s business plans and erode Arconic’s competitiveness.Arconic may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.Arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, 23Table of Contentsregulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Arconic. The Company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. The Company may be a party to litigation in a foreign jurisdiction where geopolitical risks might influence the ultimate outcome of such litigation. The Company is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks associated with its business and products. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, product testing, health and safety, environmental matters, required record keeping and record retention, intellectual property rights, government contracts and taxes, as well as compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations governing import and export, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, sales and trading practices, human rights and modern slavery, sourcing of raw materials, third-party relationships, supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products. Arconic could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.For example, in the event that an Arconic product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, Arconic may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. In addition, if an Arconic product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, sales of the Company’s products could be diminished, and the Company could be subject to further liability claims. Even if Arconic successfully defends against these types of claims, the Company could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims; the Company’s management could be required to devote significant time, attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims; and Arconic’s reputation could suffer, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.While Arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise. The global and diverse nature of Arconic’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, see the discussion in Part I, Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).Arconic is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.Arconic’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, where no problem is currently known, at previously owned sites, sites previously operated by the Company, sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including remediation obligations, may prove to be more challenging and costly than the Company anticipates. For example, new data and information, including information about the ways in which the Company’s products are used, may lead the Company, regulatory authorities, government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations, or impose restrictions, related to the manufacturing or use of the Company’s products. This could lead to reduced sales or market acceptance of the Company’s products. Arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.24Table of ContentsArconic is subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the GDRP or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Arconic may be subject to securities litigation, which could cause the Company to incur substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.Arconic currently is, and may in the future become, subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws. Arconic is generally obliged, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify its current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits. Regardless of the outcome, securities litigation may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business results.Arconic is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), state and local wage laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), and regulations related to safety, discrimination, organizing, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments, citizenship requirements, and healthcare insurance mandates. Allegations that Arconic has violated such laws or regulations could damage the Company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which could have a material adverse impact on Arconic’s operations and financial condition.Arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.Increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems, additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards in the United States. New or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect Arconic’s customers and suppliers (through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products) or business (through an impact on Arconic’s inventory availability, cost of sales, operations or demand for Arconic products), which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company or its customers or suppliers. Also, Arconic relies on natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities. Any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the Company and its customers and suppliers, which could also have a negative impact on Arconic’s profitability.Anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Arconic, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of Arconic’s shareholders.Arconic’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Arconic’s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Arconic is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Arconic. Additionally, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes Arconic’s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other anti-takeover measures without shareholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Arconic’s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Arconic common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.25Table of ContentsDividends on Arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances.Arconic has historically paid dividends on its common stock; however, it has no obligation to do so. The existence, timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to Arconic’s shareholders falls within the discretion of Arconic’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s dividend policy may change at any time without advance notice to Arconic’s shareholders. For example, on February 8, 2019, in connection with the Company’s ongoing strategic and portfolio review, Arconic announced that it expected to reduce its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.06 to $0.02 per share. The Arconic Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Arconic’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Company’s debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that Arconic’s Board of Directors deems relevant. Arconic’s Board of Directors may determine to further reduce or eliminate Arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions or in other circumstances.Changes in the United Kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect Arconic.In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally triggered the process to withdraw from the European Union (also referred to as ""Brexit"") following the results of a national referendum that took place in June 2016. The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic are difficult to predict, but because the Company currently operates and conducts business in the United Kingdom and in Europe, Brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to Arconic’s businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with Arconic’s customers and suppliers, as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies, including the value of the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect Arconic’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the United Kingdom and the European Union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.Arconic may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation from Alcoa Corporation, and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect Arconic’s business.Arconic may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) enabling the management of each company to pursue more effectively its own distinct operating priorities and strategies, to focus on strengthening its core business and its unique needs, and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for long-term growth and profitability; (ii) permitting each company to allocate its financial resources to meet the unique needs of its own business, allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to pursue more effectively its own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies; (iii) allowing each company to articulate more effectively a clear investment thesis to attract a long-term investor base suited to its business and providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities; (iv) creating an independent equity currency tracking each company's underlying business, affording Arconic and Alcoa Corporation direct access to the capital markets and facilitating each company’s ability to consummate future acquisitions or other restructuring transactions utilizing its common stock; (v) allowing each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets, due to the common nature of the underlying businesses; and (vi) separating and simplifying the structures required to manage two distinct and differing underlying businesses.Arconic may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) Arconic may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if Alcoa Corporation were still a part of the Company because Arconic’s business is less diversified than it was prior to the completion of the Separation; and (ii) as a smaller, independent company, Arconic may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those it obtained prior to completion of the Separation. If Arconic fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Alcoa Corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation.In connection with the Separation, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and also entered into various other agreements, of which the following were still in effect during 2018: a Tax Matters Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, intellectual property license agreements, a metal supply agreement, real estate and office leases and a spare parts loan agreement. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the 26Table of ContentsCompany prior to the Separation was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. Arconic will rely on Alcoa Corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Alcoa Corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.In connection with the Separation from Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation has agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities and Arconic has agreed to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities. If Arconic is required to pay under these indemnities to Alcoa Corporation, Arconic’s financial results could be negatively impacted. The Alcoa Corporation indemnity may be insufficient to hold Arconic harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Alcoa Corporation will be allocated responsibility, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation has agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities, and Arconic has agreed to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that Arconic may be required to provide Alcoa Corporation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact Arconic’s business. Third parties could also seek to hold Arconic responsible for any of the liabilities that Alcoa Corporation has agreed to retain. Any amounts Arconic is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require Arconic to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the Company’s operating business. Further, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Arconic against the full amount of such liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable, Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Arconic’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Separation could result in substantial tax liability.It was a condition to the Distribution that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and the Distribution received by Arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to Arconic’s Board of Directors and (ii) Arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the Distribution. However, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Arconic or Alcoa Corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation- related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding Arconic’s receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Arconic of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Arconic, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic shareholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.If the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Arconic shareholders who received Alcoa Corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.Under current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution may nevertheless be 27Table of Contentsrendered taxable to Arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain post-Distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of Arconic or Alcoa Corporation. The possibility of rendering the Distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit Arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of Arconic’s business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation may be required to indemnify Arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of Alcoa Corporation stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing actively to conduct certain of its businesses, (v) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa Corporation or (vi) any of Alcoa Corporation’s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable, Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, Arconic and Arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect Arconic’s business, results of operations and financial condition.",>Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.None.28Table of Contents,">Item 2.

The Arconic Technology Center for research and development is located at 100 Technical Drive, New Kensington, Pennsylvania 15069-0001.Arconic leases some of its facilities; however, it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or the properties’ values.Arconic believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of properties owned by Arconic has been made for the purpose of this report, the Company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties.

Legal Proceedings.In the ordinary course of its business, Arconic is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential.Environmental MattersArconic is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA) or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The Company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites. The most significant of these matters, the remediation of the Grasse River in Massena, NY, is discussed in the Environmental Matters section of Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental Matters”.Reynobond PEAs previously reported, on June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, UK caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic, Arconic Architectural Products SAS (AAP SAS), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metro Police, a Public Inquiry by the British government and a consumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. AAP SAS has sought and received core participant status in the Public Inquiry. The Company will no longer sell the PE product for architectural use on buildings.Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al. As previously reported, a purported class action complaint related to the Grenfell Tower fire was filed on August 11, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Arconic Inc. and Klaus Kleinfeld. A related purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on August 25, 2017, under the caption Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al., against Arconic Inc., two former Arconic executives, several current and former Arconic directors, and banks that acted as underwriters for Arconic’s September 18, 2014 preferred stock offering (the “Preferred Offering”). The plaintiff in Sullivan had previously filed a purported class action against the same defendants on July 18, 2017 in the Southern District of New York and, on August 25, 2017, voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice. On February 7, 2018, on motion from certain putative class members, the court consolidated Howard and Sullivan, closed Sullivan, and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case. On April 9, 2018, the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated purported class action filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that the registration statement for the Preferred Offering contained false and misleading statements and omitted to state material information, including by allegedly failing to disclose material uncertainties and trends resulting from sales of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses and by allegedly expressing a belief that appropriate risk management and compliance programs had been adopted while concealing the risks posed by Reynobond PE sales. The consolidated amended complaint also alleges that between November 4, 2013 and June 23, 2017 Arconic and Kleinfeld made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information about the Company’s commitment to safety, business and financial prospects, and the risks of the Reynobond PE product, including in Arconic’s Form 10-Ks for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, its Form 10-Qs and quarterly financial press releases from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2017, its 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Annual Reports, and its 2016 Annual Highlights Report. The consolidated amended complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On June 8, 2018, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint for failure to state a claim. Briefing on that motion is now closed and the parties await a ruling.Raul v. Albaugh, et al. As previously reported, on June 22, 2018, a derivative complaint was filed nominally on behalf of Arconic by a purported Arconic shareholder against all current members of Arconic’s Board of Directors, Klaus Kleinfeld and Ken Giacobbe, naming Arconic as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint raises similar allegations as the consolidated amended complaint in Howard, as well as allegations that the defendants improperly authorized the sale of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses, and asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Delaware state law. On July 13, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to stay this case until the final resolution of the Howard case, the Grenfell Tower public inquiry in London, and the investigation by the London Metropolitan Police Service and on June 23, 2018, the Court approved the stay.While the Company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. Given the preliminary nature of these matters and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. The Board of Directors has also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of shareholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board 30Table of Contentsauthorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board and others. The Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee of the Board to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to these shareholder demand letters. The Special Litigation Committee and the Board are continuing to consider the appropriate responses to the shareholder demand letters in view of developments in proceedings concerning the Grenfell Tower fire. Other MattersAs previously reported, Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury as a result of occupational or other exposure to asbestos. Arconic, its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries have numerous insurance policies over many years that provide coverage for asbestos related claims. Arconic has significant insurance coverage and believes that Arconic’s reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations, cash flows, and financial position of the Company.TaxPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, the Company shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation for, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the Company with respect to, the following matter.As previously reported, in July 2013, following a Spanish corporate income tax audit covering the 2006 through 2009 tax years, an assessment was received mainly disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. Arconic filed another appeal in Spain’s National Court in March 2015 which was denied in July 2018. The National Court’s decision requires the assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years to be reissued to take into account the outcome of the 2003 to 2005 audit which was closed in 2017. The Company estimates the revised assessment to be $174 million (€152 million), including interest.The Company has petitioned to the Supreme Court of Spain to review the National Court’s decision. If the petition is accepted, the Supreme Court will review the assessment on its merits and render a final decision. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in appealing the assessment to the Supreme Court of Spain, a portion of the assessment may be offset with existing net operating losses and tax credits available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement. As a result of the National Court decision, an income tax reserve, including interest, of $60 million (€52 million) was established in 2018. Concurrent with the establishment of the reserve, an indemnification receivable of $29 million (€25 million), representing Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of the liability, was also recorded in 2018.Additionally, while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit, it is possible that the Company may receive assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013. Any potential assessment for an individual tax year is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated operations. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter.Matters Previously Reported – Alcoa CorporationWe have included the matters discussed below in which the Company remains party to proceedings relating to Alcoa Corporation in accordance with SEC regulations. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Alcoa Corporation for claims subject to indemnification. The Company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it.St. Croix ProceedingsRed Dust Docket Cases, (St. Croix) f/k/a Abednego, Laurie L.A., et al. v. St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C., et al. As previously reported, on January 14, 2010, Arconic was served with a multi-plaintiff action complaint involving several thousand individual persons claiming to be residents of St. Croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from Hurricane Georges or winds blowing material from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (“SCA”) facility on the island of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) since the time of the hurricane. This complaint, Abednego, et al. v. Alcoa, et al. was filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Arconic and SCA to remove the case to federal court, the case has been lodged in the Superior Court. The complaint names as defendants the same entities that were sued in a February 1999 action arising out of the impact of Hurricane Georges on the island and added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property.Also as previously reported, on March 1, 2012, Arconic was served with a separate multi-plaintiff action complaint involving 31Table of Contentsapproximately 200 individual persons alleging claims essentially identical to those set forth in the Abednego v. Alcoa complaint. This complaint, Abraham, et al. v. Alcoa, et al., was filed on behalf of plaintiffs previously dismissed in the federal court proceeding involving the original litigation over Hurricane Georges impacts. The matter was originally filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division, on March 30, 2011.Arconic and other defendants in the Abraham and Abednego cases filed or renewed motions to dismiss each case in March 2012 and August 2012 following service of the Abraham complaint on Arconic and remand of the Abednego complaint to Superior Court, respectively. By order dated August 10, 2015, the Superior Court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaints without prejudice to re-file the complaints individually, rather than as a multi-plaintiff filing. The order also preserves the defendants’ grounds for dismissal if new, individual complaints are filed. On July 7, 2017, the Court issued an order and associated memoranda on plaintiff’s multiple motions for extension of time to file the individual Complaints. Following the court’s July 7, 2017 order, a total of 429 complaints were filed and accepted by the court by the deadline of July 30, 2017 (and consolidated into the Red Dust Claims docket (Master Case No.: SX-15-CV-620)). These complaints include claims of about 1,260 individual plaintiffs. On December 11, 2017, the court issued a new scheduling order and further set a scheduling conference for January 18, 2018. At that conference, the court set the next status conference for late July 2018.The July 2018 status conference was canceled. On November 5, 2018, notice of an order of reassignment was entered, transferring the claims to the newly created Complex Litigation Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. Following the transfer, the Court scheduled a status conference to discuss the most efficient manner in which to proceed with discovery. The conference took place on January 24, 2019. The Court has not issued a discovery schedule. On January 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking for a determination that expert testimony will not be required on the issue of causation, which defendants opposed. The Court has not ruled on that motion. Other ContingenciesIn addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, tax and antitrust matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company.",>Item 4.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the Separation of Alcoa Corporation from the Company, the Company’s common stock traded under the symbol “AA.” In connection with the separation, on November 1, 2016, the Company changed its stock symbol and its common stock began trading under the symbol “ARNC.”On October 5, 2016, the Company’s common shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding and authorized shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares, and proportionately decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1.8 billion to 0.6 billion shares. The Company’s common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on October 6, 2016.On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the Separation of its business into two independent, publicly traded companies: the Company and Alcoa Corporation. The Separation was effected by means of a pro rata distribution by the Company of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Company’s shareholders. The Company’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company retained 19.9% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Separation. See disposition of retained shares in Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.The number of holders of record of common stock was approximately 11,668 as of February 15, 2019.32Table of ContentsStock Performance GraphThe following graph compares the most recent five-year performance of the Company’s common stock with (1) the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500® Index, (2) the S&P 500® Materials Index, a group of 25 companies categorized by Standard & Poor’s as active in the “materials” market sector, (3) the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index, a group of 33 companies categorized by Standard & Poor’s as active in the “aerospace & defense” industry and (4) the S&P 500® Industrials Index, a group of 69 companies categorized by Standard & Poor’s as active in the “industrials” market sector.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts; shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt])OverviewOur BusinessArconic (“Arconic” or the “Company”) is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, industrial applications, defense, and packaging. Arconic is a global company operating in 18 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 65% and 24%, respectively, of Arconic’s sales in 2018. In addition, Arconic has operating activities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia, among others. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.Management Review of 2018 and Outlook for the FutureIn 2018, Arconic’s revenues increased 8% over 2017 as a result of higher volumes across all segments including strong volume growth in aerospace engines and defense, automotive, commercial transportation, industrial, and building and construction end markets; higher aluminum pricing and favorable product mix primarily impacting the Global Rolled Products segment; and favorable foreign currency movements; partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market; lower sales of $90 from the divestiture of the Latin America extrusions business (divested in April 2018), $54 from the divestiture of the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy (divested in March 2017), and $46 from the ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations (completed in December 2018); and costs of $38 in 2018 related to settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions. In the segments, Segment operating profit decreased 6% from 2017 as volume growth was more than offset by performance shortfalls in the disks operations, manufacturing inefficiencies in the Engineered Structures business, unfavorable product mix, and higher aluminum prices. Net income was $642 in 2018 compared to a Net loss of $74 in 2017. There were several significant items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company recognized proceeds of approximately $300 in cash and recorded a gain of $119 ($154 pre-tax) on the sale of the Texarkana rolling mill. The Company recorded a loss of $39 ($43 pre-tax) on the sale of the Eger, Hungary forgings business. The Company also recorded a charge of $72 ($92 pre-tax) for pension plan settlement charges associated with significant lump sum payments made to participants. Additionally, the Company recorded several discrete tax items, including benefits related to the reversal of a foreign deferred tax liability of $74 as well as the release of valuation allowances and revaluation of deferred taxes.Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has continued its intensified focus on capital efficiency. This focus and the related results enabled Arconic to end 2018 with a solid financial position.The following financial information reflects certain key measures of Arconic’s 2018 results:•Sales of $14,014, up 8% from 2017, with growth from all segments as key end markets remained healthy, and Net income of $642, or $1.30 per diluted share;•Total segment operating profit of $1,581, a decrease of $97, or 6%, from 20171;•Cash provided from operations of $217, cash used for financing activities of $649, and cash provided from investing activities of $565, reflecting improvements in working capital;•Cash on hand at the end of the year of $2,277; and•Total debt of $6,330, a decrease in total debt of $514 from 2017.(1) For the reconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Consolidated income before income taxes and related information, see page 43.On January 22, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board) had determined to no longer pursue a potential sale of Arconic as part of its strategy and portfolio review. Management and the Board have been conducting a rigorous and comprehensive strategy and portfolio review over the past year and as part of that process had considered a sale of the Company, among other matters. However, the Company did not receive a proposal for a full-Company transaction that management and the Board believed would be in the best interest of Arconic’s shareholders and other stakeholders. Management and the Board remain confident in Arconic’s significant potential and are strongly focused on enhancing value for shareholders, through continued operational improvements and through other potential initiatives which have been previously identified in the strategy and portfolio review. The Company has announced the following key initiatives as part of its ongoing 35Table of Contentsstrategy and portfolio review:•Commenced plans to reduce operating costs by approximately $200 on an annual run-rate basis, designed to maximize the impact in 2019;•Announced the planned separation of its portfolio into Engineered Products and Forgings and Global Rolled Products, with a spin-off of one of the businesses;•Considering the potential sale of businesses that do not best fit into one of the two segments above;•Intends to execute its previously authorized $500 share repurchase program in the first half of 2019;•The Board also authorized an additional $500 of share repurchases, effective through the end of 2020; and•Expects to reduce its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.06 to $0.02 per share.On February 6, 2019, the Company announced that the Board appointed John C. Plant, current Chairman of the Board, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective February 6, 2019, to succeed Chip Blankenship, who ceased to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and resigned as a member of the Board, in each case as of that date. In addition, the Company announced that the Board appointed Elmer L. Doty, current member of the Board, as President and Chief Operating Officer, a newly created position, effective February 6, 2019. Mr. Doty will remain a member of the Board. The Company also announced that Arthur D. Collins, Jr., current member of the Board, has been appointed interim Lead Independent Director of the Company, effective February 6, 2019.On February 19, 2019, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank to repurchase $700 of its common stock, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board. Under the ASR agreement, Arconic will receive initial delivery of approximately 32 million shares on February 21, 2019. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of Arconic’s common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount. The ASR agreement is expected to be completed during the first half of 2019. The Company will evaluate its organizational structure in conjunction with the planned separation of its portfolio and changes to its reportable segments are expected in the first half of 2019.    In 2019, management projects that sales will be up approximately 2% to 4% supported by increases in most of the Company’s key end markets, as robust growth and the Company’s unique position in those markets is expected to continue. These increases will be partly offset by the expected decline in aluminum prices in 2019 compared with 2018. Earnings per share is expected to grow as management continues to focus on operational performance and driving further cost reductions. The Company expects favorable impacts from volume, net cost savings, aerospace pricing, and lower aluminum pricing, which will be pressured by the continuation of new product introductions in aerospace as well as higher transportation costs and aluminum scrap spreads.  Cash flows are expected to keep pace for the full year in 2019 compared with 2018, resulting from improved operating performance and the focus on capital efficiency that is expected to drive lower capital expenditures. Cash flows in the first quarter of 2019 are expected to reflect the typical use of cash based on anticipated timing of working capital increases and interest payments.2016 Separation Transaction. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the separation of its business into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation. Following the Separation Transaction, Arconic comprises the Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Ma’aden Rolling Company), the Engineered Products and Solutions, and the Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation comprises the Alumina and Primary Metals segments, the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Ma’aden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia.The Separation Transaction was effected by the distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Company’s shareholders (the “Distribution”). The Company’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company distributed 146,159,428 shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the Distribution and retained 36,311,767 shares, or approximately 19.9% (see disposition of retained shares under Results of Operations below), of the common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation is now an independent public company trading under the symbol “AA” on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Company trades under the symbol “ARNC” on the New York Stock Exchange.On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and 36Table of ContentsOperations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement. The Toll Processing and Services Agreement expired by its terms at the end of 2018.Results of OperationsEarnings SummarySales. Sales for 2018 were $14,014 compared with $12,960 in 2017, an increase of $1,054, or 8%. The increase was the result of strong volume growth across all segments, primarily in the aerospace engines and defense, automotive, commercial transportation, industrial, and building and construction end markets; higher aluminum prices and favorable product mix primarily in the Global Rolled Products segment; and favorable foreign currency movements; partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market; lower sales of $190 from the divestitures of the Latin America extrusions business (divested in April 2018), the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy (divested in March 2017), and the ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations (completed in December 2018); and costs of $38 in 2018 related to settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions.Sales for 2017 were $12,960 compared with $12,394 in 2016, an increase of $566, or 5%. The increase was the result of strong volume growth in all segments and higher aluminum pricing, partially offset by the planned ramp down and Toll Processing Agreement relating to the Company’s North America packaging business in Tennessee in the Global Rolled Products segment, as well as unfavorable product pricing in both the Engineered Products and Solutions and Global Rolled Products segments. Pursuant to the Toll Processing Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation on October 31, 2016 in connection with the Separation Transaction, Arconic provides can body stock to Alcoa Corporation using aluminum supplied by Alcoa Corporation, resulting in the absence of metal sales in 2017 compared to 2016.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). COGS as a percentage of Sales was 81.3% in 2018 compared with 78.9% in 2017. The increase was the result of higher aluminum prices; unfavorable aerospace product mix; higher transportation costs; manufacturing inefficiencies in the Engineered Structures business; performance shortfalls in the disks operations; costs related to settlements of certain customer claims noted above; and the impact of a $23 charge related to a physical inventory adjustment at one plant in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment that was recorded in the second quarter of 2018. While a portion of this charge for the physical inventory adjustment related to prior years, the majority related to the first half of 2018. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual periods.COGS as a percentage of Sales was 78.9% in 2017 compared with 78.2% in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to cost increases, including net higher aluminum prices of $84 and ramp-up costs related to new commercial aerospace engines, and a lower margin product mix, partially offset by net cost savings.Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses (SG&A). SG&A expenses were $604, or 4.3% of Sales, in 2018 compared with $715, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2017. The decrease in SG&A was the result of proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58, costs related to the separation of Alcoa Inc. of $18, and costs associated with the Company’s Delaware reincorporation of $3 in 2017, none of which recurred in 2018. Additionally, lower expenses driven by lower annual incentive compensation accruals and overhead cost reductions were somewhat offset by an increase in legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $4 as well as strategy and portfolio review costs of $7 in 2018.SG&A expenses were $715, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2017 compared with $924, or 7.5% of Sales, in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was the result of expenses related to the Separation Transaction of $193 in 2016 compared to $18 in 2017, as well as ongoing overhead cost reduction efforts, partially offset by proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58, external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $14, and costs associated with the Company’s Delaware reincorporation of $3 in 2017.Research and Development Expenses (R&D). R&D expenses were $103 in 2018 compared with $109 in 2017 and $130 in 2016. The decrease in both periods was the result of lower spending.Provision for Depreciation and Amortization (D&A). The provision for D&A was $576 in 2018 compared with $551 in 2017 and $535 in 2016. The increase in both periods was primarily due to capital projects placed into service. Impairment of Goodwill. In 2017, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $719 related to the annual impairment review of the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions business (see Goodwill under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below).Restructuring and Other Charges. Restructuring and other charges were $9 in 2018 compared with $165 in 2017. The decrease of $156 was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Texarkana rolling mill of $154, lower layoff costs, and a postretirement curtailment benefit of $28, partially offset by pension plan settlement charges of $96 associated with significant lump sum payments made to participants, a loss on the sale of the Eger, Hungary forgings business of $43, and pension curtailment charges of $23. In 2017, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill of $60 and a charge for the impairment of assets associated with the sale of the Latin America extrusions business of $41. See Note T to the 37Table of Contentsto the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Restructuring and other charges were $165 in 2017 compared with $155 in 2016. The increase of $10 was primarily due to a loss of $60 on the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill and a charge of $41 for the impairment of assets associated with the sale of the Latin America extrusions business (divested in 2018) in 2017, partially offset by $57 for costs related to the exit of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K. and $37 for exit costs related to the decision in 2016 to permanently shut down a can sheet facility. See Note T to the to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Interest Expense. Interest expense was $378 in 2018 compared with $496 in 2017. The decrease of $118, or 24%, was the result of higher costs incurred in 2017 related to the early redemption of the Company’s outstanding debt than were incurred during 2018, as well as lower debt outstanding.Interest expense was $496 in 2017 compared with $499 in 2016. The decrease of $3, or 1%, was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from lower outstanding debt, mostly offset by $73 primarily in higher premiums paid in 2017 related to the early redemption of $1,250 in debt. In the second quarter of 2017, Arconic redeemed all of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018 and 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the Company’s 5.72% Notes due 2019 in advance of the respective maturity dates.Other Expense (Income), Net. Other expense, net was $79 in 2018 compared with Other income, net of $486 in 2017. The decrease in other income, net of $565 was the result of gains recorded during 2017 related to the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock of $351, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange (in April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the “Investment Banks”) in exchange for cash and the Company’s remaining 12,958,767 shares (valued at $35.91 per share) in Alcoa Corporation stock and recorded a gain of $167), income of $81 associated with an adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition (see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), and income of $25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee, none of which recurred in 2018, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, somewhat offset by lower non-service related net periodic benefit cost and the benefit of $29 from establishing a tax indemnification receivable reflecting Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of a Spanish tax reserve (see Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K).Other income, net was $486 in 2017 compared with Other expense, net of $41 in 2016. The increase in other income, net of $527 was primarily due to the gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock of $351 (in February 2017, the Company sold 23,353,000 shares of Alcoa Corporation stock at $38.03 per share, which resulted in cash proceeds of $888 and a gain of $351) and the gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, income of $25 associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition (see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), and income of $25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee. The Company was required to provide a guarantee for an Alcoa Corporation electricity contract in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated the electricity contract at its Rockdale Operations and, as a result, Arconic reversed its associated guarantee liability.Income Taxes. Arconic’s effective tax rate was 26.0% in 2018 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $60 charge to establish a tax reserve in Spain, a $59 net charge resulting from the Company’s finalized analysis of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 (""the 2017 Act""), a $13 charge for U.S. state taxes, foreign income taxed in higher rate jurisdictions, and foreign losses with no tax benefit, partially offset by a $74 benefit related to the reversal of a foreign recapture obligation, a $38 benefit to reverse a foreign tax reserve that is effectively settled, and a $10 benefit for the release of U.S. valuation allowances. Arconic’s effective tax rate was 115.7% in 2017 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of a $719 impairment of goodwill, a $41 impairment of assets in the Latin America extrusions business, and a $60 charge related to the sale of a rolling mill in Italy that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $272 tax charge as a provisional impact of the 2017 Act, and a $23 tax charge for an increase in an uncertain tax position in Germany, partially offset by a $73 tax benefit related to the sale and Debt-for-Equity Exchange of the Alcoa Corporation stock, a $69 tax benefit for the release of U.S. state valuation allowances net of the federal tax benefit, a $27 favorable tax impact associated with a non-taxable earn-out liability adjustment in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition, and by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions.Arconic’s effective tax rate was 356.5% in 2016 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K), a $95 tax charge associated with the redemption of company-owned life insurance 38Table of Contentspolicies whose tax basis was less than the redemption amount resulting in a taxable gain, a $51 net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate and tax law changes, and a $34 unfavorable tax impact related to certain separation costs which are nondeductible for income tax purposes, somewhat offset by a $39 discrete income tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances in Canada and Russia, a $38 tax benefit related to currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income, and a $26 favorable tax impact associated with non-taxable settlement proceeds and earn-out liability adjustments in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition.Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2019 will be between 26.5% and 28.5%. However, business portfolio actions, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stock-based payment awards, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate.Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations After Income Taxes. Income from continuing operations after income taxes was $642 for 2018, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations after income taxes of $74 for 2017, or $0.28 per share. The increase in results of $716 was due in part to the following items that occurred in 2017 but did not recur in 2018: a charge for goodwill impairment of $719 ($719 pre-tax); gains related to the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and the Debt-for-Equity Exchange of $405 ($518 pre-tax); and favorable adjustments of $97 ($106 pre-tax) to contingent earn-out and guarantee liabilities as noted below. Additional favorable impacts in 2018 included: volume growth across all segments; lower SG&A expenses due to proxy and separation costs incurred in 2017 and not recurring in 2018, as well as lower incentive compensation accruals; lower Restructuring and other charges driven primarily by the gain on sale of the Texarkana rolling mill, offset by pension settlement charges and the loss on sale of the Eger, Hungary forgings business; lower Interest expense due to lower debt levels; lower pension expenses; and lower Income taxes. These favorable impacts were partially offset by unfavorable aerospace product mix, higher aluminum prices, manufacturing inefficiencies in the Engineered Structures business, performance shortfalls in the disks operations, settlements of certain customer claims, and an unfavorable physical inventory adjustment at one plant.Loss from continuing operations after income taxes was $74 for 2017, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with $1,062 for 2016, or $2.58 per share. The increase in results of $988 was primarily attributable to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the Separation Transaction in 2016; a gain of $238 ($351 pre-tax) on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and a gain of $167 ($167 pre-tax) on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange in 2017; income of $25 ($25 pre-tax) associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition and income of $16 ($25 pre-tax) due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee; net cost savings; and higher sales volumes across all segments; partially offset by a charge for goodwill impairment of $719 ($719 pre-tax); a charge related to the 2017 Act of $272; $47 ($73 pre-tax) of higher premiums paid for the early redemption of debt in 2017; higher LIFO inventory expense associated with higher aluminum prices; charges for asset impairments of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill of $60 ($60 pre-tax) and Latin America extrusions business of $41 ($41 pre-tax) based on the sale of these businesses; unfavorable product pricing, primarily in aerospace; and lower-margin product mix.Segment InformationArconic’s operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments: Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products and Transportation and Construction Solutions (see below). In the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance from Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to Segment operating profit, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Segment performance under Arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Arconic’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and other charges and Impairment of goodwill. Segment operating profit also includes certain items that, under the previous segment performance measure, were recorded in Corporate, such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting, metal price lag, intersegment profit eliminations, and derivative activities. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between segment totals and consolidated Arconic are in Corporate. Prior period financial information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.Segment operating profit for all reportable segments totaled $1,581 in 2018, $1,678 in 2017, and $1,622 in 2016. The following information provides Sales and Segment operating profit for each reportable segment, as well as certain shipment data for Global Rolled Products, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. See Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.39Table of ContentsEngineered Products and Solutions 2018 2017 2016Third-party sales$6,316 $5,943 $5,728Segment operating profit$891 $964 $955The Engineered Products and Solutions segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys); seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks), and extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the oil and gas, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, British pound and the euro.On December 31, 2018, as part of the Company’s ongoing strategy and portfolio review, Arconic completed the sale of its Eger, Hungary forgings business that manufactured high volume steel forgings for drivetrain components in the European heavy-duty truck and automotive market. This business generated third-party sales of $32, $38, and $29 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and had 180 employees at the time of the divestiture. See Restructuring and other charges under Results of Operations above.In April 2016, Arconic completed the sale of the Remmele Medical business (that was part of the RTI International Metals Inc. (RTI) acquisition) that manufactured precision-machined metal products for customers in the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets. Remmele Medical generated third-party sales of $23 from January 1, 2016 through the divestiture date, and, at the time of the divestiture, had approximately 330 employees.Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased $373, or 6%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily attributable to higher volumes in the aerospace engines and defense end markets and favorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine market and lower aerospace pricing principally in the fasteners business.Third-party sales for this segment increased $215, or 4%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily attributable to volume growth in both aerospace engines and airframes, partially offset by lower product pricing, primarily in the aerospace end market, and the absence of sales of $23 related to the Remmele Medical business, which was sold in April 2016.Segment operating profit for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment decreased $73, or 8%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily attributable to performance shortfalls in the disks operations; manufacturing inefficiencies in the Engineered Structures business, including the now resolved forging press outage at the Cleveland facility that impacted the fourth quarter of 2018 with higher costs of $10; unfavorable aerospace engine mix and new product introductions; a physical inventory adjustment of $23; and lower aerospace pricing principally in the fasteners business; partly offset by the strength in aerospace engine and defense volumes.Segment operating profit for this segment increased $9, or 1%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily on higher volumes and net cost savings, partially offset by product pricing pressures, ramp up costs associated with increasing production volumes of new aerospace engine parts, and a lower margin product mix.In 2019, demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, driven by the ramp-up of new aerospace engine platforms. Demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing ramp-up of certain aerospace programs, while declines in the industrial gas turbine market are expected to continue, albeit at lower levels than in 2018. Net cost savings and favorable pricing are expected.40Table of ContentsGlobal Rolled Products(1)  2018 2017 2016Third-party sales$5,604 $5,000 $4,865Intersegment sales160 148 118Total sales$5,764 $5,148 $4,983Segment operating profit$386 $424 $421Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt)1,249 1,197 1,339(1) Excludes the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were previously part of the Global Rolled Products segment but became part of Alcoa Corporation effective November 1, 2016.The Global Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro, the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and the British pound.On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) announced new sanctions against Russian “oligarchs” and extended those sanctions to companies that are majority-owned or substantively controlled by those oligarchs. These sanctions block U.S. persons - both individuals and companies - from engaging in transactions with listed oligarchs and their companies. These sanctions originally extended to UC Rusal PLC (“Rusal”), which supplies primary aluminum to Arconic in Europe, the United States, and to the Company’s Samara plant in Russia. The Company operated under a series of temporary licenses issued by OFAC until January 27, 2019 when OFAC removed Rusal from the list of sanctioned parties. The Company complies with and expects to continue to comply with all other aspects of these sanctions and we do not anticipate any interruption in Samara’s ability to operate normally.In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its Fusina, Italy rolling mill. The rolling mill generated third-party sales of $54 and $165 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the time of the divestiture, the rolling mill had approximately 312 employees.   See Restructuring and other charges under Results of Operations above.On November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon the completion of the Separation Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic provided a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the end date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation supplied all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic processed the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenue for 2018, 2017, and the two months ended December 31, 2016 was $144, $190 and $37, respectively.Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment increased $604, or 12%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily attributable to higher aluminum prices; higher volumes in the automotive, commercial transportation, and industrial end markets; and favorable product mix; partially offset by the absence of sales of $54 from the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy (divested in March 2017) and the planned ramp down of Arconic's North American packaging operations (completed in December 2018).Third-party sales for this segment increased $135, or 3%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily attributable to volume growth in the automotive end market and higher aluminum pricing, partially offset by the impact of $362 associated with the ramp-down and Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation at the Company’s North America packaging business in Tennessee, the absence of sales of $111 from the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy, aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates, and pricing pressures in the global packaging market.Segment operating profit for the Global Rolled Products segment decreased $38, or 9%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily driven by unfavorable aerospace wide-body production mix, higher aluminum prices, and higher transportation costs and scrap spreads, partially offset by higher automotive, commercial transportation and industrial volumes. The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted segment operating profit margin by $30, or 100 basis points, in 2018 compared with 2017.Segment operating profit for this segment increased $3, or 1%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily driven by net cost savings and increased automotive volumes, partially offset by lower aerospace volume from customer destocking and reduced build rates, continued pricing pressure on global packaging products and higher aluminum prices. The higher aluminum prices 41Table of Contentsnegatively impacted segment operating profit margin by $37, or 150 basis points, in 2017 compared with 2016.In 2019, demand in the North America commercial transportation, brazing, and industrial end markets is expected to grow as a result of the International Trade Commission initiated common alloy trade case. Demand in the automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminum-intensive vehicles. Demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat as the ramp-up of new programs is offset by lower build rates for aluminum intensive wide-body programs. Net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue.Transportation and Construction Solutions  2018 2017 2016Third-party sales$2,126 $2,011 $1,802Segment operating profit$304 $290 $246The Transportation and Construction Solutions segment produces products that are used mostly in the commercial transportation and nonresidential building and construction end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold both directly to customers and through distributors. A small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are primarily the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Brazilian real.On July 31, 2018, the Company announced that it had initiated a sale process of its Building and Construction Systems (BCS) business, as part of the Company’s ongoing strategy and portfolio review that commenced in January 2018. BCS generated third-party sales of approximately $1,140, $1,070, and $1,010 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The sale process continues to progress. The Company’s decision regarding whether to sell the business will not be finalized until final binding offers are evaluated. Until the Company makes that final decision, the BCS business will remain classified as held and in-use in the Consolidated Financial Statements.On April 2, 2018, Arconic completed the sale of its Latin America extrusions business as part of its continued drive to streamline its business portfolio, reduce complexity and further focus on its higher-margin products and profitable growth. This business generated sales of $25, $115, and $103 in 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively, and had 612 employees at the time of the divestiture. See Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above.Third-party sales for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increased $115, or 6%, in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily driven by higher volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets, favorable foreign currency movements and higher aluminum prices, partially offset by the absence of sales of $90 resulting from the divestiture of the Latin America extrusions business in April 2018. Third-party sales for this segment increased $209, or 12%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily driven by increased volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets, higher aluminum pricing, and favorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by lower product pricing.Segment operating profit for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increased $14, or 5%, in 2018 compared with 2017, principally driven by higher volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets and net cost savings, which more than offset higher aluminum prices. The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted segment operating margin by $57, or 270 basis points, in 2018 compared with 2017.Segment operating profit for this segment increased $44, or 18%, in 2017 compared with 2016, principally driven by net cost savings and higher volumes, partially offset by lower product pricing in the heavy-duty truck market, unfavorable product mix, and higher aluminum prices. The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted segment operating margin by $8, or 90 basis points, in 2017 compared with 2016.In 2019, we expect continued growth in the North American and European commercial transportation and building and construction markets and continued demand for innovative products. Net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue.42Table of ContentsReconciliation of Total segment operating profit to Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes 2018 2017 2016Total segment operating profit$1,581 $1,678 $1,622Unallocated amounts:     Impairment of goodwill— (719) —Restructuring and other charges(9) (165) (155)Corporate expense(247) (314) (513)Consolidated operating income$1,325 $480 $954Interest expense(378) (496) (499)Other (expense) income, net(79) 486 (41)Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes$868 $470 $414See Restructuring and Other Charges, Impairment of Goodwill, Interest Expense, and Other Expense (Income), Net discussions above under Results of Operations for reference. Corporate expense decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58 and costs related to the separation of Alcoa Inc. of $18 in 2017, neither of which recurred in 2018. Also, lower expenses driven by lower annual incentive compensation accruals and overhead cost reductions were partially offset by costs incurred in the second quarter of 2018 related to the settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions of $38, an increase in legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $4, and strategy and portfolio review costs of $7 in 2018.Corporate expense decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily attributable to costs incurred in 2016 related to the Separation Transaction, partially offset by proxy, advisory and governance-related costs and legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower incurred in 2017.Environmental MattersSee the Environmental Matters section of Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesArconic maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. Management continued to focus on actions to improve Arconic’s cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures.Cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Arconic’s operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.At December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents of Arconic were $2,277, of which $541 was held by Arconic's non-U.S. subsidiaries. If the cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries were to be repatriated to the U.S., the company does not expect there to be additional material income tax consequences.The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows has not been restated for discontinued operations, therefore the discussion below concerning Operating Activities, Financing Activities, and Investing Activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the results of both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation up through the completion of the Separation Transaction on November 1, 2016.Operating ActivitiesCash provided from operations in 2018 was $217 compared with cash used for operations of $39 in 2017. The increase of $256 was primarily due to lower working capital of $209 and a favorable change in noncurrent liabilities of $169 due primarily to reversals in 2017 related to the Firth Rixson earn-out liability of $81 and separation-related guarantee liability of $25, partially offset by lower operating results. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes of $277 in accounts payable, $127 in taxes, including income taxes, and $118 in inventories, partially offset by unfavorable changes of $227 in receivables, $74 in accrued expenses, and $12 in prepaid expenses and other current assets.Cash used for operations in 2017 was $39 compared with Cash provided from operations $95 in 2016. The decrease of $134 was primarily due to lower operating results and higher pension contributions of $20, partially offset by a favorable change in 43Table of Contentsnoncurrent assets of $111 due to the prepayment of $200 made in April 2016 related to a gas supply agreement for the Australia alumina refineries (Alcoa Corporation), a favorable change in noncurrent liabilities of $55, and lower cash used for working capital of $17. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes of $101 in receivables; $87 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; and $278 in accrued expenses; mostly offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, including $163 in inventories; $170 in accounts payable, trade; and $116 in taxes, including income taxes.Financing ActivitiesCash used for financing activities was $649 in 2018 compared with $1,015 in 2017 and $757 in 2016.The use of cash in 2018 was principally the result of $1,103 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the remaining outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019 (see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K) and $119 in dividends to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $600 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities.The use of cash in 2017 was principally the result of $1,634 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018, 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the 5.72% Notes due 2019 (see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K); $162 in dividends to shareholders; and $52 in premiums paid on early redemption of debt. These items were partially offset by $816 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities, and $50 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.The use of cash in 2016 was principally the result of $2,734 in payments on debt, mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilitates (see below) and the repayment in December 2016 of $750 of outstanding principal of 5.55% Notes due February 2017; $228 in dividends to shareholders; and $175 in net cash paid to noncontrolling interests (Alcoa Corporation). These items were mostly offset by $1,962 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowing under certain revolving credit facilities, and $421 in net cash transferred from Alcoa Corporation at the completion of the Separation Transaction.In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI, Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder’s option under specific conditions. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes, holders will receive, at Arconic’s election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,453,000 shares using the December 31, 2018 conversion rate of 35.9125 shares per $1,000 (not in millions) bond or per-share conversion price of $27.8455), or a combination of cash and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) bond, together with accrued and unpaid interest.In September 2014, Arconic completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic’s 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share, and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% Notes due 2024. The net proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this noncash equity transaction.Arconic maintains a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein that expires on June 29, 2023 and provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $3,000. In addition to the Credit Agreement, Arconic has a number of other credit agreements that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $715 as of December 31, 2018. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.Arconic’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Arconic by the major credit rating agencies.On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3. On February 7, 2019, S&P changed the outlook from stable to negative credit watch. On November 1, 2016, Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) downgraded Arconic’s long-term debt rating from Ba1, a non-investment grade, to Ba2 and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade Liquidity-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2. Additionally, Moody’s changed the outlook from negative to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on November 2, 2017 and October 8, 2018). On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the outlook from evolving to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on July 3, 2017). On September 44Table of Contents27, 2018, Fitch changed the outlook from stable to positive (ratings and outlook were affirmed on September 27, 2018).Investing ActivitiesCash provided from investing activities was $565 in 2018 compared with $1,320 in 2017 and $591 in 2016.The source of cash in 2018 included cash receipts from sold receivables of $1,016 and proceeds from the sale of the Texarkana, Texas rolling mill and cast house of $302, partially offset by capital expenditures of $768, including the horizontal heat treat furnace at the Davenport, Iowa plant and an expansion of a wheels plant in Szekesfehervar, Hungary. The source of cash in 2017 included proceeds of $888 from the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock, cash receipts from sold receivables of $792, and the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project of $243, somewhat offset by cash used for capital expenditures of $596, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher and horizontal heat treat furnace) at the Davenport, Iowa plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility, and the injection of $10 into the Fusina rolling business prior to its sale.The source of cash in 2016 was mainly due to $778 of cash receipts from sold receivables, $692 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, including $457 from the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies, $120 in proceeds related to the sale of the Intalco smelter wharf property (Alcoa Corporation), and $102 in proceeds ($99 net of transaction costs) from the sale of the Remmele Medical business, which was part of Arconic’s acquisition of RTI in July 2015; and $280 in sales of investments, composed primarily of $145 for an equity interest in a natural gas pipeline in Australia (Alcoa Corporation) and $130 for securities held by Arconic’s captive insurance company. These sources of cash were partially offset by $1,125 in capital expenditures ($298 Alcoa Corporation), 29% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, Iowa plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility.  Noncash Financing and Investing ActivitiesOn October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks for the remaining portion of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K.On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock, pursuant to the authorization provided at a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the Company’s Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively.In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 76 million shares. As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, in the Company’s Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity at December 31, 2016, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares.45Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual Obligations. Arconic is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Arconic also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2018, a summary of Arconic’s outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 ThereafterOperating activities:         Energy-related purchase obligations$72 $37 $28 $7 $—Raw material purchase obligations829 652 155 19 3Other purchase obligations102 81 13 6 2Operating leases379 94 128 70 87Interest related to total debt2,326 351 592 370 1,013Estimated minimum required pension funding1,860 255 840 765 —Other postretirement benefit payments730 90 170 170 300Layoff and other restructuring payments25 19 4 1 1Deferred revenue arrangements18 12 6 — —Uncertain tax positions187 — — — 187Financing activities:         Total debt6,330 421 2,243 623 3,043Dividends to shareholders— — — — —Investing activities:         Capital projects665 532 133 — —Totals$13,523 $2,544 $4,312 $2,031 $4,636Obligations for Operating ActivitiesEnergy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from one year to five years. Raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, titanium sponge, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to six years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. It is Arconic’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Arconic contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. In 2018, the Company funded $298, of which $72 was contributed to its U.S. plans in excess of the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The estimates reported in the preceding table include amounts sufficient to meet the minimum required, along with a $34 contribution in 2019 related to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) (see Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-K). Arconic has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2023 and 2028, respectively.Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs, special layoff benefit payments, and lease termination costs, while payments expected to be paid over the next several years relate to lease termination costs.Deferred revenue arrangements require Arconic to deliver product to a customer over the specified contract period through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract. While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made.46Table of ContentsUncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2018. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “Thereafter” column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.Obligations for Financing ActivitiesArconic has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Arconic paid $119 in dividends to shareholders during 2018. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Arconic’s Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2018, there were 483,270,717 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding Class A preferred stock. In 2018, the annual preferred stock dividend was $3.75 per share and the annual common stock dividend was $0.24 per share.Obligations for Investing ActivitiesCapital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2018. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 in 2019.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt December 31, 2018, Arconic has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2019 and 2026 was $37 at December 31, 2018.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $6 and $8 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Arconic was required to provide payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party related to project financing for Alcoa Corporation’s aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. During the third quarter of 2018, Arconic was released from this guarantee. Furthermore, Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant Generation Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee. For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,087 and $1,297 at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. This guarantee expires in 2047. For this guarantee, subject to its provisions, Arconic is secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation. Arconic currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote.In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one-year claims purchase agreement with a bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium was paid by Alcoa Corporation. The agreement matured in December 2017 and was not renewed in 2018 due to the decline in exposure to guarantee claims including a substantial reduction in the guarantees related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and also the elimination of the guarantee related to the Rockdale energy contract. In December 2018, Arconic entered into a one-year insurance policy with a limit of $80 relating to the remaining long-term energy supply agreement. The premium is expected to be paid by Alcoa Corporation. The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement or insurance policy will be made on an annual basis going forward.Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2019, was $136 at December 31, 2018.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $54 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.Arconic has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these surety bonds, which expire at various dates, primarily in 2019, was $50 at December 31, 2018.47Table of ContentsPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $25 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters; the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic had six reporting units for 2018, of which three were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment (Arconic Fastening Systems, Arconic Engines, Arconic Engineered Structures), two were included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment (Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products and Building and Construction Systems), and the remaining reporting unit was the Global Rolled Products segment.In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the 48Table of Contentsexistence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.During the 2018 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all six of its reporting units. The estimated fair values for each of the six reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 25%, thus, there was no goodwill impairment. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow model (DCF) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, capital spending, and discount rate. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Goodwill impairment tests in 2017 and 2016 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units, except for the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (AFE) business whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value. As such, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719. The decrease in the AFE fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year.Properties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments.In the second quarter of 2018, the Company updated its three-year strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the disks operations, an asset group within the AEN business unit. As such, the Company evaluated the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing their carrying value of approximately $515 to the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the disks operations, resulting in an estimated fair value in excess of their carrying value of approximately 13%; thus, there was no impairment. If the disks operations do not achieve the revised forecasted financial performance or if there are changes in any significant assumptions, a material non-cash impairment of long-lived assets may occur in future periods. These significant assumptions include sales growth, cost of raw materials, ramp up of additional production capacity, and working capital. A 1% decrease in the forecasted net cash flows would reduce the undiscounted cash flows by approximately $6. There were no indicators of impairment identified for the disks operations during the third or fourth quarters of 2018 and, as such, the Company did not evaluate the recoverability of its long-lived assets.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.49Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.35%, 3.75%, and 4.20%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $170 and either a charge or credit of approximately $2 to after-tax earnings in the following year.In conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology, the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the “spot rate” approach). This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2018, 2017, and 2016 of $24, $34, and $84, respectively, for pension plans and $4, $6, and $14, respectively, for other postretirement benefit plans. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2018, 2017, and 2016, management used 7.00%, 7.75%, and 7.75%, respectively, as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. For 2019, management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. The decrease of 75 basis points in the 2018 expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $10 for 2019.In 2018, a net loss of $114 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance that permits a reclassification to Accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as well as the plan asset performance that was less than expected, which were partially offset by the increase in the discount rate of 60 basis points and the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2017, a net loss of $220 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and plan asset performance less than expected, which were partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2016, a net benefit of $1,601 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the transfer of $2,080 to Alcoa Corporation which was partially offset by a net charge of $479. The charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which were partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses.Stock-Based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.50Table of ContentsCompensation expense recorded in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $50 ($39 after-tax), $54 ($36 after-tax), and $76 ($51 after-tax), respectively. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.The 2017 Act created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. The 2017 Act also established the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). Until regulations are finalized, judgement will be required to apply preliminary guidance, including proposed regulations, to Arconic’s facts and circumstances.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI income inclusions.  Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment.  Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that supports the realizability of deferred tax assets.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Management’s Reports to Arconic ShareholdersManagement’s Report on Financial Statements and PracticesThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Based on the assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. /s/ John C.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaFebruary 21, 2019We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1950.53Table of ContentsArconic and

Financial Statements(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts)A. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and subsidiaries (“Arconic” or the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and require management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation (see below and Note C)On January 1, 2018, Arconic adopted new guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) related to the following: presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost that required a reclassification of costs within the Statement of Consolidated Operations; presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows that required a reclassification of amounts between operating and either financing or investing activities; the classification of restricted cash within the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows; and the reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Accumulated deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. See Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance below for further details.Also on January 1, 2018, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance from Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to Segment operating profit, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. See Note C for further details.The separation of Alcoa Inc. into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation, became effective on November 1, 2016 (the “Separation Transaction”). The financial results of Alcoa Corporation for 2016 have been retrospectively reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for 2016. The cash flows and comprehensive income related to Alcoa Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows and Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss), respectively, for 2016. See Note V for additional information related to the Separation Transaction and discontinued operations.Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arconic and companies in which Arconic has a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which Arconic cannot exercise significant influence are accounted for on the cost method.Management also evaluates whether an Arconic entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether Arconic is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. Arconic does not have any variable interest entities requiring consolidation.Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.Inventory Valuation. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost for approximately half of U.S. inventories determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of other inventories is determined under a combination of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average-cost methods.Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded principally on the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of structures and machinery and equipment by reporting segment (numbers in years): Structures Machinery and equipmentEngineered Products and Solutions29 17Global Rolled Products31 21Transportation and Construction Solutions27 18Gains or losses from the sale of asset groups are generally recorded in Restructuring and other charges while the sale of individual assets are recorded in Other expense (income), net (see policy below for assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations). Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Interest related to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs.59Table of ContentsProperties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments. See Note N for further information.Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic had eight reporting units for 2017 and 2016, of which four were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment (Arconic Fastening Systems and Rings, Arconic Power and Propulsion, Arconic Forgings and Extrusions, and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products), three were included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment (Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products, Building and Construction Systems, and Latin America Extrusions), and the remaining reporting unit was the Global Rolled Products segment.In January 2018, management changed the organizational structure of the businesses in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment from four business units to three business units with a focus on aligning its internal structure to core markets and customers and reducing cost. As a result, management assessed and concluded that each of the three new business units (Arconic Fastening Systems (AFS), Arconic Engines (AEN), and Arconic Engineered Structures (AES)) represent reporting units for goodwill impairment evaluation purposes. Goodwill was reallocated to the three new reporting units and both the historical and new Engineered Products and Solutions reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2018. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value; thus, there was no goodwill impairment. In April 2018, Arconic completed the sale of its Latin America extrusions business and, therefore, it is no longer a reporting unit for the Company. More than 90% of Arconic’s total goodwill at December 31, 2018 was allocated to the three Engineered Products and Solutions reporting units: AEN ($2,065), AFS ($1,607), and AES ($507).In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the 2018 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all six of its reporting units. The estimated fair values for each of the six reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 25%, thus, there was no goodwill impairment. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a 60Table of Contentsdiscounted cash flow model (DCF) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, capital spending, and discount rate. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.In connection with the interim impairment evaluation of long-lived assets for the disks operations (an asset group within the AEN business unit) in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted from a decline in forecasted financial performance for the business in connection with its updated three-year strategic plan, the Company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for the AEN reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value; thus, there was no impairment of goodwill.  Goodwill impairment tests in 2017 and 2016 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units, except for the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (AFE) business whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value. As such, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719. The decrease in the AFE fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year.Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by reporting segment (numbers in years): Software Other intangible assetsEngineered Products and Solutions5 33Global Rolled Products5 9Transportation and Construction Solutions5 16Revenue Recognition. The Company's contracts with customers are comprised of acknowledged purchase orders incorporating the Company’s standard terms and conditions, or for larger customers, may also generally include terms under negotiated multi-year agreements. These contracts with customers typically consist of the manufacture of products which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied upon transfer of control of the product to the customer. The Company produces fastening systems; seamless rolled rings; investment castings, including airfoils and forged jet engine components; extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts; aluminum sheet and plate; integrated aluminum structural systems; architectural extrusions; and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels. Transfer of control is assessed based on alternative use of the products we produce and our enforceable right to payment for performance to date under the contract terms. Transfer of control and revenue recognition generally occur upon shipment or delivery of the product, which is when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (truck, train, or vessel). An invoice for payment is issued at time of shipment. The Company’s objective is to have net 30-day terms. Our business units set commercial terms on which Arconic sells products to its customers. These terms are influenced by industry custom, market conditions, product line (specialty versus commodity products), and other considerations.In certain circumstances, Arconic receives advanced payments from its customers for product to be delivered in future periods. These advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the product is delivered and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred revenue is included in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is 61Table of Contentsdeemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) income inclusions.  Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment.  Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Stock-Based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.Foreign Currency. The local currency is the functional currency for Arconic’s significant operations outside the United States, except for certain operations in Canada and Russia, where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. The determination of the functional currency for Arconic’s operations is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators.Acquisitions. Arconic’s business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Statement of Consolidated Operations from the date of the acquisition.62Table of ContentsDiscontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale. For those businesses where management has committed to a plan to divest, each business is valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets of a business to be divested once they are classified as held for sale. Businesses to be divested are generally classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as either discontinued operations or held for sale.For businesses classified as discontinued operations, the balance sheet amounts and results of operations are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, respectively, for all periods presented. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows is not required to be reclassified for discontinued operations for any period. Segment information does not include the assets or operating results of businesses classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These businesses are expected to be disposed of within one year.For businesses classified as held for sale that do not qualify for discontinued operations treatment, the balance sheet and cash flow amounts are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale for all periods presented. The results of operations continue to be reported in continuing operations. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The segment information includes the assets and operating results of businesses classified as held for sale for all periods presented.Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In May 2014, the FASB issued changes to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. These changes created a comprehensive framework for all entities in all industries to apply in the determination of when to recognize revenue and, therefore, supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition requirements and guidance. This framework is expected to result in less complex guidance in application while providing a consistent and comparable methodology for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s), and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018. Arconic adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. There was no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2018, as the adoption did not result in a change to our timing of revenue recognition, which continues to be at a point in time. See the Revenue Recognition policy above.In January 2016, the FASB issued changes to equity investments. These changes require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values using the measurement alternative of cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Also, the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values has been simplified by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. Also, the new guidance required changes in fair value of equity securities to be recognized immediately as a component of net income instead of being reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the gain (loss) is realized. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and have been applied on a prospective basis. Arconic elected the measurement alternative for its equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2016, the FASB issued changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The guidance identifies eight specific cash flow items and the sections where they must be presented within the statement of cash flows. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and have been be applied retrospectively. As a result of the adoption, Arconic reclassified cash received related to beneficial interest in previously transferred trade accounts receivable from operating activities to investing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This new accounting standard does not reflect a change in our underlying business or activities. The reclassification of cash received related to beneficial interest in previously transferred trade accounts receivable was $792 and $778 for 2017 and 63Table of Contents2016, respectively. In addition, Arconic reclassified $52 and $3 of cash paid for debt prepayments including extinguishment costs from operating activities to financing activities for 2017 and 2016, respectively.In November 2016, the FASB issued changes to the classification of cash and cash equivalents within the statement of cash flow. Restricted cash and cash equivalents will be included within the cash and cash equivalents line on the cash flow statement and a reconciliation must be prepared to the statement of financial position. Transfers between restricted cash and cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents will no longer be presented as cash flow activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows and for material balances of restricted cash and cash equivalents, Arconic will disclose information regarding the nature of the restrictions. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and have been applied retrospectively. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Restricted cash was $6, $4, and $15 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.In March 2017, the FASB issued changes to the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new guidance requires registrants to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item or items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Also, only the service cost component will be eligible for asset capitalization. Registrants will present the other components of net periodic benefit cost separately from the service cost component; and, the line item or items used in the income statement to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disclosed. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and were adopted retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit cost in the Statement of Consolidated Operations, and prospectively for the asset capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost. The Company recorded the service related net periodic benefit cost within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general administrative, and other expenses and Research and development expenses and recorded the non-service related net periodic benefit cost (except for the curtailment cost which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges) separately from service cost in Other expense (income), net within the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The impact of the retrospective adoption of this guidance was an increase to consolidated Operating income of $154 and $135, while there was no impact to consolidated Net income, for 2017 and 2016, respectively. In May 2017, the FASB issued clarification to guidance on the modification accounting criteria for share-based payment awards. The new guidance requires registrants to apply modification accounting unless three specific criteria are met. The three criteria are 1) the fair value of the award is the same before and after the modification, 2) the vesting conditions are the same before and after the modification and 3) the classification as a debt or equity award is the same before and after the modification. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and were applied prospectively to new awards modified after adoption. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows an optional reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. Stranded tax effects were created when deferred taxes, originally established in Other comprehensive income at 35%, were revalued to 21% as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. The Company elected to early adopt this provision in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reclassified $367 of beneficial stranded tax effects in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Accumulated deficit in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity.  In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which requires cloud computing arrangement implementation costs to be accounted for in accordance with the software stage model, regardless of whether or not the cloud computing arrangement contains a license. Arconic adopted this guidance in the third quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Also, in August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance to eliminate or modify certain disclosure requirements that have become redundant, overlapping, outdated or superseded in light of other SEC rules, GAAP or changes in the information environment. This guidance became effective on November 5, 2018 and will be applied to filings thereafter. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. In February 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting and presentation of leases. These changes require lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability. Also, when measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, optional payments should be included only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, exercise a purchase option, or not exercise an option to terminate the lease. As originally released, the standards update required application at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented at the time of adoption. However, in July 2018, the FASB provided entities the option to instead apply the provisions of the new leases guidance at the effective date, without adjusting the comparative periods presented. The Company expects to apply the provisions of the new 64Table of Contentsleases guidance at the effective date, without adjusting the comparative periods presented. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019.Arconic’s current operating lease portfolio is primarily comprised of land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment. A cross-functional implementation team has determined the scope of arrangements that will be subject to this standard and continues to assess the impact to the Company’s systems, processes and internal controls. Arconic has contracted with a third-party vendor to implement a software solution. Concurrently, Arconic has been compiling and uploading lease data into the software solution to account for leases under the new standard. Management continues to evaluate the impact of these changes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which will require right of use assets and lease liabilities be recorded for operating leases. Arconic anticipates the impact of adoption on January 1, 2019 will result in a right of use asset and total lease liability related to operating leases in the range of $300 to $340, while the accounting for capital leases will remain unchanged. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations or Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.In June 2016, the FASB added a new impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments, trade receivables, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and other loan commitments. The CECL model does not have a minimum threshold for recognition of impairment losses and entities will need to measure expected credit losses on assets that have a low risk of loss. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance that will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. It is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019. For cash flow and net investment hedges existing at the date of adoption, Arconic will apply a cumulative-effect adjustment related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to Accumulated other comprehensive loss with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of Accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendment is adopted. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. Arconic has engaged a third-party consultant to assist with a review of the Company’s risk management and hedging strategies, with any changes to be implemented in conjunction with the adoption of the new guidance. Under the new guidance, Management expects to utilize cash flow hedge accounting of its variable priced purchases and sales. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance that impacts disclosures for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These changes become effective for Arconic's annual report for the year ending December 31, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20. 65Table of ContentsB.

Segment and Geographic Area InformationArconic is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, industrial applications, defense, and packaging. Arconic’s segments are organized by product on a worldwide basis. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance from Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to Segment operating profit, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Segment performance under Arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment operating profit. Arconic’s definition of Segment operating profit is Operating income excluding Special items. Special items include Restructuring and other charges and Impairment of goodwill. Segment operating profit also includes certain items that, under the previous segment performance measure, were recorded in Corporate, such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting, metal price lag, intersegment profit eliminations, and derivative activities. Segment operating profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between segment totals and consolidated Arconic are in Corporate. Prior period financial information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note A). Transactions among segments are established based on negotiation among the parties. Differences between segment totals and Arconic’s consolidated totals for line items not reconciled are in Corporate.Arconic’s operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments as follows:Engineered Products and Solutions. This segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys); seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks); and extruded, 66Table of Contentsmachined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the oil and gas, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets.Global Rolled Products. This segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers.Transportation and Construction Solutions. This segment produces products that are used mostly in the commercial transportation and nonresidential building and construction end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold both directly to customers and through distributors. A small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market.67Table of ContentsThe operating results and assets of Arconic’s reportable segments were as follows: Engineered Products and Solutions Global Rolled Products Transportation and Construction Solutions Total2018       Sales:       Third-party sales$6,316 $5,604 $2,126 $14,046Intersegment sales— 160 — 160Total sales$6,316 $5,764 $2,126 $14,206Profit and loss:       Segment operating profit$891 $386 $304 $1,581Restructuring and other charges71 (156) 1 (84)Provision for depreciation and amortization282 212 50 5442017       Sales:       Third-party sales$5,943 $5,000 $2,011 $12,954Intersegment sales— 148 — 148Total sales$5,943 $5,148 $2,011 $13,102Profit and loss:       Segment operating profit$964 $424 $290 $1,678Restructuring and other charges30 72 52 154Provision for depreciation and amortization268 205 50 5232016       Sales:       Third-party sales$5,728 $4,865 $1,802 $12,395Intersegment sales— 118 — 118Total sales$5,728 $4,983 $1,802 $12,513Profit and loss:       Segment operating profit$955 $421 $246 $1,622Restructuring and other charges78 40 14 132Provision for depreciation and amortization255 201 48 5042018       Assets:       Capital expenditures$349 $255 $111 $715Goodwill4,179 245 76 4,500Total assets10,346 3,934 1,089 15,3692017       Assets:       Capital expenditures$308 $178 $57 $543Goodwill4,205 252 78 4,535Total assets10,325 3,955 1,041 15,321The following tables reconcile certain segment information to consolidated totals:For the year ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Sales:     Total segment sales$14,206 $13,102 $12,513Elimination of intersegment sales(160) (148) (118)Corporate(32) 6 (1)Consolidated sales$14,014 $12,960 $12,39468Table of ContentsFor the year ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Total segment operating profit$1,581 $1,678 $1,622Unallocated amounts:     Impairment of goodwill— (719) —Restructuring and other charges(9) (165) (155)Corporate expense(247) (314) (513)Consolidated operating income$1,325 $480 $954Interest expense(378) (496) (499)Other (expense) income, net(79) 486 (41)Consolidated income before income taxes$868 $470 $414December 31,2018 2017Assets:   Total segment assets$15,369 $15,321Unallocated amounts:   Cash and cash equivalents2,277 2,150Deferred income taxes573 743Corporate fixed assets, net305 310Fair value of derivative contracts37 91Other132 103Consolidated assets$18,693 $18,718Sales by major product grouping were as follows:For the year ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Sales:     Innovative flat-rolled products$5,588 $4,992 $4,864Engines2,940 2,708 2,560Engineered structures1,839 1,743 1,683Fastening systems1,531 1,484 1,463Architectural aluminum systems1,140 1,065 1,010Aluminum wheels969 805 689Other7 163 125 $14,014 $12,960 $12,394Geographic information for sales was as follows (based upon the country where the point of sale occurred):For the year ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Sales:     United States$9,137 $8,167 $7,823France936 965 930Hungary823 739 619United Kingdom737 721 711China632 615 582Russia553 500 433Germany302 309 284Canada285 261 262Brazil214 285 250Japan170 141 145Other225 257 355 $14,014 $12,960 $12,39469Table of ContentsGeographic information for long-lived assets was as follows (based upon the physical location of the assets):December 31,2018 2017Long-lived assets:   United States$4,148 $4,005China326 347Hungary257 227Russia253 276United Kingdom253 259France163 159Germany84 88Canada61 63Brazil54 62Other105 108 $5,704 $5,594D.

In 2018, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $9 ($9 after-tax), which included a net gain on the sale of several assets and businesses of $109 ($81 after-tax), primarily made up of a gain on the asset sale of Texarkana of $154 ($119 after-tax) and loss on the sale of the Eger, Hungary forgings business of $43 ($39 after-tax) (see note T); charges of $96 ($75 after-tax) for pension settlement and $23 ($18 after-tax) for pension curtailment; a postretirement curtailment benefit of $28 ($22 after-tax) (see note G); and a charge of $20 ($17 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 125 employees (89 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment and 36 in Corporate); a charge of $12 ($9 after-tax) for contract termination costs and asset impairments associated with the shutdown of a facility in Acuna, Mexico; a charge of $6 ($4 after-tax) for contract termination costs related to the New York office; a charge of $8 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments; and a benefit of $19 ($15 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2018, approximately 110 of the 125 employees were separated. The remaining separations for 2018 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2019. In 2018, cash payments of $9 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2018 restructuring programs.2017 Actions. In 2017, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $165 ($143 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $69 ($47 after-tax) for layoff costs related to cost reduction initiatives including the separation of approximately 880 employees (400 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 245 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 135 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, and 100 in Corporate), a charge of $60 ($60 after-tax) related to the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill; a charge of $41 ($41 after-tax) for the impairment of assets associated with the sale of the Latin America extrusions business (see Note T); a net benefit of $6 ($4 after-tax) for the reversal of forfeited executive stock compensation of $13, partially offset by a charge of $7 for the related severance; a net charge of $12 ($7 after-70Table of Contentstax) for other miscellaneous items; and a favorable benefit of $11 ($8 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2018, approximately 570 of the 660 employees (previously 760) were separated. The total number of employees associated with 2017 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within Arconic and natural attrition. The remaining separations for 2017 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2019. In 2018 and 2017, cash payments of $34 and $28, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2017 restructuring programs.2016 Actions. In 2016, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $155 ($114 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $57 ($46 after-tax) for costs related to the exit of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K.; $37 ($24 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down a can sheet facility; $20 ($14 after-tax) for costs related to the closures of five facilities, primarily in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including the separation of approximately 280 employees; $53 ($33 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,315 employees (1,045 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 210 in Corporate, 30 in the Global Rolled Products segment, and 30 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment); $11 ($8 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for the sale of Remmele Medical, an RTI subsidiary; $2 ($1 after-tax) for a pension settlement; and $25 ($12 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.In 2016, management made the decision to exit certain legacy Firth Rixson facilities in the U.K. Costs related to these actions included asset impairments and accelerated depreciation of $51; other exit costs of $4; and $2 for the separation of 60 employees.Also in 2016, management approved the shutdown and demolition of the can sheet facility in Tennessee upon completion of the Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation. Costs related to this action included $21 in asset impairments; $9 in other exit costs; and $7 for the separation of 145 employees. The other exit costs of $9 represent $4 in asset retirement obligations and $3 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish the can sheet facility in Tennessee, and $2 in other exit costs.As of December 31, 2018, the separations associated with the 2016 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, cash payments of $4, $26, and $16, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2016 restructuring programs.Activity and reserve balances for restructuring charges were as follows:  Layoffcosts Otherexit costs TotalReserve balances at December 31, 2015$84 $9 $932016     Cash payments(73) (13) (86)Restructuring charges70 27 97Other(1)(31) (14) (45)Reserve balances at December 31, 2016$50 $9 $592017     Cash payments$(59) $(6) $(65)Restructuring charges64 1 65Other(2)1 (2) (1)Reserve balances at December 31, 2017$56 $2 $582018     Cash payments$(47) $(2) $(49)Restructuring charges111 13 124Other(3)(110) 2 (108)Reserve balances at December 31, 2018$10 $15 $25(1) In 2016, Other for layoff costs included reversals of previously recorded restructuring charges of $25, effects of foreign currency translation and other of $4, and a reclassification of $2 in pension costs, as the impact was reflected in Arconic’s separate liability for Accrued pension benefits. Other for other exit costs included reclassifications of $8 in asset retirement and $2 in environmental obligations, as the impacts were reflected in Arconic’s separate liabilities 71Table of Contentsfor asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation, and a reclassification of $4 in legal obligations, as the impact was included in Arconic’s separate liability for legal costs.(2) In 2017, Other for layoff costs included a reclassification of a stock awards reversal of $13, offset by reversals of previously recorded restructuring charges of $11 and foreign currency translation of $1.(3) In 2018, Other for layoff costs included reclassifications of $119 in pension costs and a $28 credit in postretirement benefits, as the impacts were reflected in Arconic's separate liabilities for Accrued pension benefits and Accrued postretirement benefits, and reversals of previously recorded restructuring charges of $19.The remaining reserves are expected to be paid in cash during 2019, with the exception of approximately $5 to $7, which is expected to be paid over the next several years for lease termination costs.E.

In 2017, Net loss (gain) from asset sales included a gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock of $351 (see Note V) and a gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange (see Note V). In 2017, Other, net included an adjustment of $81 to the contingent earn-out liability related to the 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson (see Note T) and an adjustment of $25 associated with a separation-related guarantee liability (see Note U). In 2016, Non-service related net periodic benefit cost included a reduction of the recognition of actuarial losses and a methodology change in the calculation of interest cost, which were partially offset by the reduction in the expected return on plan assets. In 2016, Other, net included an adjustment of $56 to the contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment of $20, both related to the acquisition of Firth Rixson.72Table of ContentsG. Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsArconic maintains pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in foreign locations. Pension benefits generally depend on length of service, job grade, and remuneration. Substantially all benefits are paid through pension trusts that are sufficiently funded to ensure that all plans can pay benefits to retirees as they become due. Most salaried and non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after March 1, 2006 participate in a defined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.Arconic also maintains health care and life insurance postretirement benefit plans covering eligible U.S. retired employees and certain retirees from foreign locations. Generally, the medical plans are unfunded and pay a percentage of medical expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life benefits are generally provided by insurance contracts. Arconic retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to change or eliminate these benefits. All salaried and certain non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2002 and certain bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for postretirement health care benefits. All salaried and certain hourly U.S. employees that retire on or after April 1, 2008 are not eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits.Effective January 1, 2015, Arconic no longer offers postretirement health care benefits to Medicare-eligible, primarily non-bargaining, U.S. retirees through Company-sponsored plans. Qualifying retirees (hired prior to January 1, 2002), both current and future, may access these benefits in the marketplace by purchasing coverage directly from insurance carriers.In the first quarter of 2018, the Company announced that, effective April 1, 2018, benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company's qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargaining hourly employees ceased. As a result of this change, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued pension benefits liability of $136 related to the reduction of future benefits, $141 offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and curtailment charges of $5 in Restructuring and other charges.On April 13, 2018, the United Auto Workers ratified a new five-year labor agreement, covering approximately 1,300 U.S. employees of Arconic, which expires on March 31, 2023. A provision within the agreement includes a retirement benefit increase for future retirees that participate in a defined benefit pension plan, which impacts approximately 300 of those employees. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, benefit accruals for future service will cease. As result of these changes, a curtailment charge of $9 was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the second quarter of 2018.In the third quarter of 2018, the Company announced that effective December 31, 2018, it will end all pre-Medicare medical, prescription drug and vision coverage for current and future salaried and non-bargained hourly employees and retirees of the Company and its subsidiaries. As a result of this change, in the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a decrease to the Accrued other postretirement benefits liability of $32 related to the reduction of future benefits, $4 offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and a curtailment benefit of $28 in Restructuring and other charges.In the fourth quarter, the company communicated to plan participants that effective in the first quarter of 2019, benefit accruals for future service and compensation for employees in the United Kingdom defined benefit pension plans will cease. The plan curtailment resulted in a $13 decrease in the Accrued pension benefits liability which was offset in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, on October 29, 2018, the United Kingdom High Court ruled that defined benefit pension plans offering Guaranteed Minimum Pensions must review benefits accrued between May 1990 to April 1997 to ensure gender pay equality. The review resulted in an increase to the Accrued pension benefits liability of $9 and a corresponding curtailment charge that was recorded in Restructuring and other charges.In the third and fourth quarters of 2018, settlement accounting applied to certain U.S. pension plans due to lump sum payments to participants, resulting in settlement charges of $96 that were recorded in Restructuring and other charges.73Table of ContentsThe funded status of all of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of December 31 each calendar year.Obligations and Funded Status Pension benefits Otherpostretirement benefitsDecember 31,2018 2017 2018 2017Change in benefit obligation       Benefit obligation at beginning of year$7,359 $7,026 $927 $980Service cost46 90 7 7Interest cost219 234 28 30Amendments18 1 (25) —Actuarial (gains) losses(372) 311 (51) 1Settlements(146) — — —Curtailments(154) — — —Benefits paid(422) (425) (86) (98)Medicare Part D subsidy receipts— — 6 7Foreign currency translation impact(72) 122 — —Benefit obligation at end of year(1)$6,476 $7,359 $806 $927Change in plan assets(1)       Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$4,862 $4,666 $— $—Actual return on plan assets(144) 212 — —Employer contributions298 310 — —Benefits paid(397) (404) — —Administrative expenses(33) (33) — —Settlements(178) — — —Foreign currency translation impact(74) 111 — —Fair value of plan assets at end of year(1)$4,334 $4,862 $— $—Net funded status$(2,142) $(2,497) $(806) $(927)Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of:       Noncurrent assets$111 $89 $— $—Current liabilities(23) (22) (83) (86)Noncurrent liabilities(2,230) (2,564) (723) (841)Net amount recognized$(2,142) $(2,497) $(806) $(927)Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:       Net actuarial loss$2,957 $3,240 $87 $146Prior service cost (benefit)3 10 (27) (37)Net amount recognized, before tax effect$2,960 $3,250 $60 $109Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:       Net actuarial (gain) loss $(19) $481 $(52) $1Amortization of accumulated net actuarial loss(264) (220) (7) (5)Prior service cost (benefit)19 — (25) —Amortization of prior service (cost) benefit(26) (5) 35 8Net amount recognized, before tax effect$(290) $256 $(49) $4(1) At December 31, 2018, the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status for U.S. pension plans were $5,282, $3,123, and $(2,159), respectively.

The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times.The rate of compensation increase is based upon actual experience. For 2019, the rate of compensation increase will be 3.5%, which approximates the five-year average.Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (assumptions for non-U.S. plans did not differ materially): 2018 2017 2016Discount rate to calculate service cost(1)3.75% 4.20% 4.29%Discount rate to calculate interest cost(1)3.30 3.60 3.15Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets7.00 7.75 7.75Rate of compensation increase3.50 3.50 3.50Cash balance plan interest crediting rate3.00 3.00 3.00(1) In all periods presented, the respective discount rates were used to determine net periodic benefit cost for most U.S. pension plans for the full annual period. However, the discount rates for a limited number of plans were updated during 2018, 2017, and 2016 to reflect the remeasurement of these plans due to new union labor agreements, settlements, and/or curtailments. The updated discount rates used were not significantly different from the discount rates presented.In conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs is determined in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the interest component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology, the interest cost component is determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the “spot rate” approach). This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2018, 2017, and 2016 of $24, $34, and $84, respectively, for pension plans and $4, $6, and $14, respectively, for other postretirement benefit plans. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing 76Table of Contentsthis assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2018, 2017, and 2016, the expected long-term rate of return used by management was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2018, management reduced the expected long-term rate of return by 75 basis points due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average. For 2019, management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. Assumed health care cost trend rates for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (assumptions for non-U.S. plans did not differ materially): 2018 2017 2016Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year5.50% 5.50% 5.50%Rate to which the cost trend rate gradually declines4.50 4.50 4.50Year that the rate reaches the rate at which it is assumed to remain2022 2021 2020The assumed health care cost trend rate is used to measure the expected cost of gross eligible charges covered by Arconic’s other postretirement benefit plans. For 2019, a 5.5% trend rate will be used, reflecting management’s best estimate of the change in future health care costs covered by the plans. The plans’ actual annual health care cost trend experience over the past three years has ranged from (3.3)% to (0.5)%. Management does not believe this three-year range is indicative of expected increases for future health care costs over the long-term.Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in these assumed rates would have the following effects: 1% increase 1% decreaseEffect on other postretirement benefit obligations$22 $(22)Effect on total of service and interest cost components1 (1)Plan AssetsArconic’s pension plans’ investment policy and weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2018 and 2017, by asset class, were as follows:  Plan assetsatDecember 31,Asset classPolicy range2018 2017Equities20–55%29% 28%Fixed income25–55%48 47Other investments15–35%23 25Total 100% 100%The principal objectives underlying the investment of the pension plans’ assets are to ensure that Arconic can properly fund benefit obligations as they become due under a broad range of potential economic and financial scenarios, maximize the long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on such obligations, and broadly diversify investments across and within various asset classes to protect asset values against adverse movements. Specific objectives for long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities and achieving diversification across the balance of the asset portfolio. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities. Exposure to broad equity risk has been decreased and diversified through investments in discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds, long/short equity hedge funds, high yield bonds, emerging market debt and global and emerging market equities. Investments are further diversified by strategy, asset class, geography, and sector to enhance returns and mitigate downside risk. A large number of external investment managers are used to gain broad exposure to the financial markets and to mitigate manager-concentration risk.Investment practices comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and other applicable laws and regulations.77Table of ContentsThe following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the trustees to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified (see Note R for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy).Equities. These securities consist of: (i) direct investments in the stock of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. companies, and equity derivatives, that are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (ii) the plans’ share of commingled funds that are invested in the stock of publicly traded companies and are valued at the net asset value of shares held at December 31 (included in Level 1); and (iii) direct investments in long/short equity hedge funds and private equity (limited partnerships and venture capital partnerships) that are valued at net asset value.Fixed income. These securities consist of: (i) U.S. government debt that are generally valued using quoted prices (included in Level 1); (ii) cash and cash equivalents invested in publicly-traded funds and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (iii) publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally corporate bonds and debentures) and are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data (included in Level 2); (iv) fixed income derivatives that are generally valued using industry standard models with market-based observable inputs (included in Level 2); and (v) cash and cash equivalents invested in institutional funds and are valued at net asset value.Other investments. These investments include, among others: (i) exchange traded funds, such as gold, and real estate investment trusts and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the investments are traded (included in Level 1) and (ii) direct investments of discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds and private real estate (includes limited partnerships) and are valued at net asset value.The fair value methods described above may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Additionally, while Arconic believes the valuation methods used by the plans’ trustees are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.78Table of ContentsThe following table presents the fair value of pension plan assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy or net asset cost:December 31, 2018Level 1 Level 2 Net asset value TotalEquities:   Equity securities$318 $— $578 $896Long/short equity hedge funds— — 232 232Private equity— — 147 147 $318 $— $957 $1,275Fixed income:   Intermediate and long duration government/credit$200 $934 $770 $1,904Other9 9 152 170 $209 $943 $922 $2,074Other investments:   Real estate$81 $— $164 $245Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds— — 471 471Other56 — 212 268 $137 $— $847 $984Net plan assets(1)$664 $943 $2,726 $4,333December 31, 2017Level 1 Level 2 Net Asset Value TotalEquities       Equity securities$379 $— $593 $972Long/short equity hedge funds— — 230 230Private equity— — 155 155 $379 $— $978 $1,357Fixed income:      Intermediate and long duration government/credit$201 $981 $779 $1,961Other164 8 145 317 $365 $989 $924 $2,278Other investments:       Real estate$85 $— $172 $257Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds— — 583 583Other77 7 275 359 $162 $7 $1,030 $1,199Net plan assets(2)$906 $996 $2,932 $4,834(1) As of December 31, 2018, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net receivable of $1, which represents securities purchased and sold but not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.(2) As of December 31, 2017, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net receivable of $28, which represents assets due from Alcoa Corporation as a result of plan separations and securities sold not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.79Table of ContentsFunding and Cash FlowsIt is Arconic’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Arconic contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. In 2018 and 2017, cash contributions to Arconic’s pension plans were $298 and $310, respectively. The $298 includes $72 contributed to the Company’s U.S. plans that was in excess of the minimum required under ERISA.The minimum required contribution to pension plans in 2019 is estimated to be $255 (of which $230 is for U.S. plans) and includes $34 related to an agreement reached with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), as discussed in the following paragraph. During the third quarter of 2016, the PBGC approved management’s plan to separate the Alcoa Inc. pension plans between Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation. The plan stipulates that Arconic will make cash contributions over a period of 30 months (from November 1, 2016) to its two largest pension plans. Payments are expected to be made in three increments of no less than $50 each ($150 total) over this 30-month period. The Company made payments of $50 in March 2018 and $50 in April 2017. In the third quarter of 2018, the 2018 U.S. pension plan valuations were completed and additional pension contributions of $16 that were made in the first quarter of 2018 were able to be used to partially satisfy the third $50 requirement. The remaining $34 payment is expected to be made in 2019. Through the end of 2018, $116 of pension contributions have been made toward the $150 requirement.Benefit payments expected to be paid to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ participants and expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts are as follows utilizing the current assumptions outlined above:For the year ended December 31,Pensionbenefits paid Gross Other post-retirementbenefits Medicare Part Dsubsidy receipts Net Other post-retirementbenefits2019$460 $90 $5 $852020460 85 5 802021455 85 5 802022455 85 5 802023450 85 5 80Thereafter2,170 300 25 275 $4,450 $730 $50 $680Defined Contribution PlansArconic sponsors savings and investment plans in various countries, primarily in the United States.

In the United States, employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, and Arconic matches a portion of these contributions in equivalent form of the investments elected by the employee.H.

Arconic recognizes the tax benefits (at a 25% rate) associated with this tax-deductible goodwill when it is amortized for local income tax purposes rather than in the period in which the transaction is consummated.A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to Arconic’s effective tax rate was as follows (the effective tax rate for all periods was a provision on income):For the year ended December 31,2018 2017 2016U.S. federal statutory rate21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %Taxes on foreign operations4.0 (8.8) (11.5)U.S. State and local taxes1.5 0.7 (0.4)Federal benefit of state tax(0.3) 3.7 0.4Permanent differences on restructuring and other charges and asset disposals(1)(16.9) (167.4) (107.8)Non-deductible acquisition costs— 0.3 8.4Statutory tax rate and law changes(2)6.5 52.5 (15.7)Tax holidays(1.6) (3.0) (0.8)Changes in valuation allowances0.9 137.9 426.8Impairment of goodwill— 53.5 —Company-owned life insurance/split-dollar net premiums— — 23.0Changes in uncertain tax positions12.8 10.1 2.1Prior year tax adjustments(2.6) (0.9) (1.7)Other0.7 2.1 (1.3)Effective tax rate26.0 % 115.7 % 356.5 %(1) Additional losses were reported in Spain's 2017 tax return related to the Separation Transaction which are offset by an increased valuation allowance.(2) In 2018, the Company finalized its accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""the 2017 Act”) and recorded an additional $59 charge. In December 2017, an estimated $272 tax charge was recorded with respect to the enactment of the 2017 Act. In December 2016, Spain and the United States enacted tax law changes which resulted in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities recorded by Arconic.On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017. Also on December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was issued by the SEC to address the application of U.S. GAAP for financial reporting. SAB 118 permitted the use of provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates in the financial statements. SAB 81Table of Contents118 also provided that the tax impact may be considered incomplete in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act.The Company calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the 2017 Act’s tax rate reduction and one-time transition tax in its 2017 year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the 2017 Act and guidance available and, as a result, recorded a $272 tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.In 2018, the Company included a $59 tax charge in income from continuing operations as a result of finalizing its accounting for the 2017 Tax Act in accordance with SAB 118. This charge primarily related to a $16 charge for the one-time transition tax and a $43 charge to update deferred tax balances.The components of net deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: 2018 2017December 31,Deferredtaxassets Deferredtaxliabilities Deferredtaxassets DeferredtaxliabilitiesDepreciation$38 $694 $31 $693Employee benefits836 27 936 23Loss provisions94 — 134 14Deferred income/expense22 1,102 19 1,144Tax loss carryforwards3,159 — 3,305 —Tax credit carryforwards579 — 638 —Other94 20 24 33 $4,822 $1,843 $5,087 $1,907Valuation allowance(2,486) — (2,584) — $2,336 $1,843 $2,503 $1,907The following table details the expiration periods of the deferred tax assets presented above:December 31, 2018Expireswithin10 years Expireswithin11-20 years Noexpiration(1) Other(2) TotalTax loss carryforwards$300 $461 $2,398 $— $3,159Tax credit carryforwards497 70 12 — 579Other— — 64 1,020 1,084Valuation allowance(752) (287) (1,390) (57) (2,486) $45 $244 $1,084 $963 $2,336(1) Deferred tax assets with no expiration may still have annual limitations on utilization. (2) Other represents deferred tax assets whose expiration is dependent upon the reversal of the underlying temporary difference. A substantial amount of Other relates to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes over an extended period of time as contributions are made to employee benefit plans and payments are made to retirees.The total deferred tax asset (net of valuation allowance) is supported by projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences (24%) and taxable temporary differences that reverse within the carryforward period (76%).Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation 82Table of Contentsallowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset GILTI income inclusions.  Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment.  Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2019 to 2027 (as of December 31, 2018). Valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period. After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies, incremental valuation allowances of $46, $9 and $302 were recognized in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foreign tax credits of $8, $57, and $128 expired at the end of 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance.  At December 31, 2018, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $417. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.Arconic released $10 and $98 of certain U.S. state valuation allowances in 2018 and 2017, respectively. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, management determined that the underlying net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income estimates taking into account expected post-separation apportionment data. Valuation allowances of $675 remain against other net state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization. The need for valuation allowances against net state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.In 2018, Arconic reduced a valuation allowance by $92 as a result of increasing a tax reserve for unrecognized tax benefits in Spain.  The valuation allowance reduction was partially offset by a $20 charge with respect to losses no longer supported by reversing temporary differences.  Arconic also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $61 and $675 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which offsets a deferred tax asset recorded for additional losses reported on the Spanish tax return related to the Separation Transaction that are not more likely than not to be realized.In 2016, Arconic recognized a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction, including $925 with respect to Alcoa Corporation’s net deferred tax assets in the United States, $302 with respect to Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States, and $42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, partially offset by $2 related to the net impact of other smaller items. After weighing all positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that the net deferred tax assets of Alcoa Corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income. As such, a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation.In 2016, Arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in Australia of $93 related to the Separation Transaction, in Spain of $163 related to a tax law change and in Luxembourg of $280 related to the Separation Transaction as well as a tax law change. These valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction, resulting in no net impact to tax expense. The need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and, as a result, the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.Arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits in 2016 related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in Russia and Canada of $19 and $20, respectively. After weighing all available evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historic cumulative income and projected taxable income.83Table of ContentsThe following table details the changes in the valuation allowance:December 31,2018 2017 2016Balance at beginning of year$2,584 $1,940 $1,291Increase to allowance136 831 772Release of allowance(154) (246) (209)Acquisitions and divestitures— (1) (1)Tax apportionment, tax rate and tax law changes(14) (24) 106Foreign currency translation(66) 84 (19)Balance at end of year$2,486 $2,584 $1,940As a result of the 2017 Act, the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (calculated based on U.S. tax principles) of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations has been subject to U.S. tax under the one-time transition tax provisions.  The 2017 Act also created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, GILTI, must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. The 2017 Act also established the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). In the first quarter of 2018, Arconic made a final accounting policy election to treat taxes due from future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Arconic has estimated a GILTI inclusion for 2018 and recorded tax expense accordingly. Arconic does not anticipate being subject to BEAT for 2018.Foreign U.S. GAAP earnings that have not otherwise been subject to U.S. tax, will generally be exempt from future U.S. tax under the 2017 Act when distributed.  Such distributions, as well as distributions of previously taxed foreign earnings, could potentially be subject to U.S. state tax in certain states, and foreign withholding taxes. Foreign currency gains/losses related to the translation of previously taxed earnings from functional currency to U.S. dollars could also be subject to U.S. tax when distributed.  At this time, Arconic has no plans to distribute such earnings in the foreseeable future. If such earnings were to be distributed, Arconic would expect the potential U.S. state tax and withholding tax impacts to be immaterial and the potential deferred tax liability associated with future foreign currency gains to be impracticable to determine.Arconic and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With a few minor exceptions, Arconic is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2006. All U.S. tax years prior to 2018 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining Arconic’s income tax returns for various tax years through 2017.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was as follows:December 31,2018 2017 2016Balance at beginning of year$73 $28 $18Additions for tax positions of the current year— 23 12Additions for tax positions of prior years143 27 —Reductions for tax positions of prior years(42) — —Settlements with tax authorities— — (1)Expiration of the statute of limitations(6) (5) (1)Foreign currency translation(2) — —Balance at end of year$166 $73 $28For all periods presented, a portion of the balance pertains to state tax liabilities, which are presented before any offset for federal tax benefits. The effect of unrecognized tax benefits, if recorded, that would impact the annual effective tax rate for 2018, 2017, and 2016 would be approximately 5%, 15%, and 6%, respectively, of pre-tax book income. Arconic does not anticipate that changes in its unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations during 2019.It is Arconic’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the Provision for income taxes on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. Arconic recognized interest of $22 and $1 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, but did not recognize any interest or penalties in 2016. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, settlements with tax authorities, and refunded overpayments, Arconic recognized interest income of $1 and $2 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, but did not recognize any interest income in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, the amount accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was $21 and $2, respectively.84Table of ContentsI. Preferred and Common StockPreferred Stock. Arconic has two classes of preferred stock: Class A Preferred Stock and Class B Serial Preferred Stock. Class A Preferred Stock has 660,000 shares authorized at a par value of $100 per share with an annual $3.75 cumulative dividend preference per share. There were 546,024 shares of Class A Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Class B Serial Preferred Stock has 10,000,000 shares authorized at a par value of $1 per share. There were no shares of Class B Serial Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (see below).In September 2014, Arconic completed a public offering under its shelf registration statement for $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each of which represents a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic’s 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share (the “Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). The 25 million depositary shares are equivalent to 2.5 million shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Each depositary share entitled the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation, and voting rights, subject to terms of the deposit agreement. Arconic received $1,213 in net proceeds from the public offering reflecting an underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used, together with the net proceeds of issued debt, to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. The underwriting discount was recorded as a decrease to Additional capital. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock constituted a series of Arconic’s Class B Serial Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to Arconic’s common stock and junior to Arconic’s Class A Preferred Stock and existing and future indebtedness. Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock generally had no voting rights.Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were cumulative in nature and paid at the rate of $26.8750 per annum per share in 2016 and 2015, which commenced January 1, 2015 (paid on December 30, 2014). On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were paid at the rate of $20.1563 per share in 2017.Common Stock. Pursuant to the authorization provided at a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders held on October 5, 2016, shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of Arconic’s outstanding and authorized shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflected a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. The number of authorized shares of common stock was also decreased from 1.8 billion shares to 0.6 billion shares. The Company’s common stock began trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis on the NYSE on October 6, 2016.In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 25 million shares (76 million shares pre-Reverse Stock Split). As a result, Common stock and Additional capital in the accompanying 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, there was no outstanding treasury stock.In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI International Metals Inc. (RTI), Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder’s option under specific conditions. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes, holders will receive, at Arconic’s election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,453,000 shares using the December 31, 2018 conversion rate of 35.9125 shares per $1,000 (not in millions) bond or per-share conversion price of $27.8455), or a combination of cash and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) bond, together with accrued and unpaid interest.At December 31, 2018, 483,270,717 shares were issued and outstanding. Dividends paid in 2018 and 2017 were $0.24 per annum or $0.06 per quarter and $0.36 per annum or $0.09 per quarter in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, 47 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under Arconic’s stock-based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2018, 41 million shares remain available for issuance. Arconic issues new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options and the conversion of stock awards.See Note W for further information on common stock repurchases.85Table of ContentsShare Activity (number of shares) Common stock  Treasury OutstandingBalance at end of 201581,051,103 1,310,160,141Issued for stock-based compensation plans(5,219,660) 5,302,128Treasury stock retirement(75,831,443) —Reverse Stock Split— (876,942,489)Balance at end of 2016— 438,519,780Conversion of convertible notes— 39,242,706Issued for stock-based compensation plans— 3,654,051Balance at end of 2017— 481,416,537Issued for stock-based compensation plans— 1,854,180Balance at end of 2018— 483,270,717Stock-Based CompensationArconic has a stock-based compensation plan under which stock options and restricted stock unit awards are granted in January each year to eligible employees. Stock options are granted at the closing market price of Arconic’s common stock on the date of grant and typically vest over a three-year service period (1/3 each year) with a ten-year contractual term. In 2018, there were stock options granted that vest over a four-year cliff service period. Restricted stock unit awards typically vest over a three-year service period from the date of grant. As part of Arconic’s stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. Certain of these awards also include performance and market conditions. For the majority of performance stock awards issued in 2018, 2017, and 2016, the final number of shares earned will be based on Arconic’s achievement of sales and profitability targets over the respective three-year performance periods. For awards issued in 2018 and 2017, the award will be earned at the end of the three-year performance period. For awards issued in 2016, one-third of the award will be earned each year based on the performance against the pre-established targets for that year. The performance stock awards earned over the three-year period vest at the end of the third year. Additionally, the 2018 and 2017 awards will be scaled by a total shareholder return (“TSR”) multiplier, which depends upon relative three-year performance against the TSRs of a group of peer companies.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, Arconic recognized stock-based compensation expense of $50 ($39 after-tax), $54 ($36 after-tax), and $76 ($51 after-tax), respectively. The expense related to restricted stock unit awards in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately 85%, 85% and 80%, respectively. No stock-based compensation expense was capitalized in any of those years. 2017 stock-based compensation expense was reduced by $13 for certain executive pre-vest cancellations which were recorded in Restructuring and other charges within the Statement of Consolidated Operations. At December 31, 2018, there was $52 (pre-tax) of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants and non-vested restricted stock unit award grants. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of the applicable equity grant. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value was equivalent to the closing market price of Arconic’s common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the 2018 and 2017 performance awards containing a market condition was $20.25 and $21.99, respectively, and was valued using a Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo simulation uses assumptions of stock price behavior to estimate the probability of satisfying market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The risk-free interest rate (2.7% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2017) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the remaining performance period. Because of limited historical information due to the Separation Transaction, volatility (32.0% in 2018 and 38.0% in 2017) was estimated using implied volatility and the representative price return approach, which uses price returns of comparable companies, was used to develop a correlation assumption. For stock options, the fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model, which generated a result of $9.79 ($10.99 for four-year cliff options), $6.26, and $4.78 per option in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The lattice-pricing model uses a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value of a stock option, including a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, exercise behavior, and contractual life. The following paragraph describes in detail the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2018 (the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2017 and 2016 were not materially different, except as noted below).The risk-free interest rate (2.5%) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the contractual life of the option. The dividend yield (0.9%) was based on a one-year average. Volatility (34.0% for 2018, 38.1% for 2017, and 44.5% in 2016) was based on comparable companies in 2018 and 2017 (except 2016 historical volatilities were used) and implied volatilities over the term of the option. Arconic utilized historical option forfeiture data to estimate annual pre- and 86Table of Contentspost-vesting forfeitures (6%). Exercise behavior (61%) was based on a weighted average exercise ratio (exercise patterns for grants issued over the number of years in the contractual option term) of an option’s intrinsic value resulting from historical employee exercise behavior. Based upon the other assumptions used in the determination of the fair value, the life of an option (6.0 years (7.3 years for four-year cliff options)) was an output of the lattice-pricing model. The activity for stock options and stock awards during 2018 was as follows (options and awards in millions): Stock options Stock awards  Number ofoptions Weightedaverageexercise price Number ofawards Weightedaverage FMVper awardOutstanding, January 1, 201811 $23.94 7 $21.49Granted 1 29.97 2 26.48Exercised(1) 18.95 — —Converted— — (1) 32.75Expired or forfeited(1) 26.96 (1) 21.10Performance share adjustment— — — 18.47Outstanding, December 31, 201810 $24.95 7 $21.13As of December 31, 2018, the number of stock options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.8 years and a total intrinsic value of $3. Additionally, 7.8 million of the stock options outstanding were fully vested and exercisable and had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.7 years, a weighted average exercise price of $25.49, and a total intrinsic value of $2 as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the cash received from stock option exercises was $16, $50, and $4 and the total tax benefit realized from these exercises was $2, $4, and $0, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $7, $13, and $1, respectively.J. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are computed by dividing earnings (loss), after the deduction of preferred stock dividends declared, by the average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding.The information used to compute basic and diluted EPS attributable to Arconic common shareholders was as follows (shares in millions):For the year ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Arconic$642 $(74) $(1,062)Less: preferred stock dividends declared(2) (53) (69)Income (loss) from continuing operations available to Arconic common shareholders640 (127) (1,131)Income from discontinued operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests(1)— — 121Net income (loss) available to Arconic common shareholders—basic640 (127) (1,010)Add: interest expense related to convertible notes11 — —Net income (loss) available to Arconic common shareholders - diluted$651 $(127) $(1,010)Average shares outstanding - basic483 451 438Effect of dilutive securities:     Stock options1 — —Stock and performance awards5 — —Convertible notes14 — —Average shares outstanding - diluted503 451 438(1) Calculated from the Statement of Consolidated Operations as Income from discontinued operations after income taxes less Net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests.87Table of ContentsThe following shares were excluded from the calculation of average shares outstanding – diluted as their effect was anti-dilutive (shares in millions). 2018 2017 2016Mandatory convertible preferred stockn/a 39 39Convertible notes— 14 14Stock options(1)9 11 13Stock awards— 7 8(1) The average exercise price of options per share was $26.79, $33.32, and $26.93 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.In 2017, had Arconic generated sufficient net income, 30 million, 14 million, 5 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options, respectively, would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding.

ReceivablesSale of Receivables ProgramArconic has an arrangement with three financial institutions to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis. The sale of such receivables is completed using a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Arconic. This arrangement provides up to a maximum funding of $400 for receivables sold. Arconic maintains a beneficial interest, or a right to collect cash, on the sold receivables that have not been funded (deferred purchase program). On March 30, 2012, Arconic initially sold $304 of customer receivables in exchange for $50 in cash and $254 of deferred purchase program under the arrangement. Arconic has received additional net cash funding of $300 ($2,958 in draws and $2,658 in repayments) since the program’s inception, including net cash draws totaling $0 ($600 in draws and $600 in repayments) in 2018 and net cash draws totaling $0 ($600 in draws and $600 in repayments) in 2017.As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, the deferred purchase program receivable was $234 and $187, respectively, which was included in Other receivables on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase program receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase program receivable. The gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collected under this program since its inception was $41,784 and $41,200 respectively. Arconic services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded.In 2018 and 2017, the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase program receivable were $6,375 and $6,328 respectively, and $5,471 and $5,367, respectively. Cash receipts from customer payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have been previously sold in this program) as well as cash receipts and cash disbursements from draws and repayments under the program are presented as cash receipts from sold receivables within investing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. See Note A for additional information on new accounting guidance that impacts the Company.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe following table details the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to customer receivables and other receivables: Customer receivables Other receivables 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016Balance at beginning of year$8 $13 $8 $34 $32 $34Provision for doubtful accounts2 1 7 7 9 6Write off of uncollectible accounts(2) (5) (3) (2) (1) (1)Recoveries of prior write-offs— — (1) (3) (3) 1Other(4) (1) 2 (5) (3) (8)Balance at end of year$4 $8 $13 $31 $34 $3290Table of ContentsM.

If valued on an average-cost basis, total inventories would have been $530 and $481 higher at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During 2018 and 2017, reductions in LIFO inventory quantities caused partial liquidations of the lower cost LIFO inventory base. These liquidations resulted in the recognition of immaterial income amounts in 2018, 2017, and 2016.In the second quarter of 2018, a charge of $23 was recorded in Cost of goods sold and Inventories to reflect a physical inventory adjustment at one plant in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. While a portion of this charge relates to prior years, the majority relates to 2018. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual periods.N.

These significant assumptions include sales growth, cost of raw materials, ramp up of additional production capacity, and working capital. A 1% decrease in the forecasted net cash flows would reduce the undiscounted cash flows by approximately $6. There were no indicators of impairment identified for the disks operations during the third or fourth quarters of 2018 and, as such, the Company did not evaluate the recoverability of its long-lived assets.91Table of ContentsO.

As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $19 in Interest expense in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for 2018 primarily for the premium paid on the early redemption of these notes in excess of their carrying value.During the second quarter of 2017, the Company announced three separate cash tender offers by the Investment Banks for the purchase of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018 (the “6.50% Bonds”), 6.75% Notes due 2018 (the “6.75% Notes”), and 5.72% Notes due 2019 (the “5.72% Notes”), up to a maximum purchase amount of $1,000 aggregate principal amount of notes, subject to certain conditions. The Investment Banks purchased notes totaling $805 aggregate principal amount, including $150 aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Bonds, $405 aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Notes, and $250 aggregate principal amount of 5.72% Notes.Also, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company agreed to acquire the notes from the Investment Banks for $409 in cash plus its remaining investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock (12,958,767 shares valued at $35.91 per share) for total consideration of $874 including accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a charge of $58 ($27 in cash) primarily for the premium for the early redemption of the notes, a benefit of $8 for the proceeds of a related interest rate swap agreement, and a charge of $2 for legal fees associated with the transaction in Interest expense, and recorded a gain of $167 in Other income, net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for the Debt-for-Equity Exchange.Finally, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the early redemption of its remaining outstanding 6.50% Bonds, with aggregate principal amount of $100, and its remaining outstanding 6.75% Notes, with aggregate principal amount of $345, for $479 in cash including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the early redemption of the 6.50% Bonds and 6.75% Notes, the Company recorded a charge of $24 in Interest expense in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for the premium paid for the early redemption of these notes in excess of their carrying value.The Company has the option to redeem certain of its Notes and Bonds in whole or part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, plus in either case accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.Credit Facilities. On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein, which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). By an Extension Request and Amendment Letter dated as of June 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to July 25, 2020. On September 16, 2016, Arconic entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement to permit the Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement, including the replacement of the 93Table of Contentsexisting financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. On June 29, 2018, Arconic entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment No. 2”) to amend and restate the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, as so amended and restated, is herein referred to as the “Credit Agreement.”The Credit Agreement provides a $3,000 Credit Facility, the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Arconic. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sublimit of $1,000 of the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Arconic shall not permit the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, to be greater than 4.50 to 1.00, which maximum level will step down successively to 4.00 to 1.00 on December 31, 2018, and to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter.The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconic’s ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Arconic’s ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconic’s ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2018, Arconic was in compliance with all such covenants.The Credit Facility matures on June 29, 2023, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Arconic may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will pay a fee of 0.25% per annum (based on Arconic’s current long-term debt ratings) of the total commitment to maintain the Credit Facility.The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.50% and 1.50% per annum, respectively, based on Arconic’s current long-term debt ratings. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.The obligation of Arconic to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) non-payment of obligations; (b) breach of any representation or warranty in any material respect; (c) non-performance of covenants and obligations; (d) with respect to other indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million, a default thereunder that causes such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity or a default in the payment at maturity of any principal of such indebtedness; (e) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic; and (f) a change in control of Arconic.There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 and no amounts were borrowed during 2018, 2017, or 2016 under the Credit Facility.In addition to the Credit Agreement above, Arconic has a number of other credit agreements that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $715 as of December 31, 2018, of which $465 is due to expire in 2019 and $250 is due to expire in 2020. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, Arconic borrowed and repaid $600, $810, and $1,950, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 3.3%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, and 46 days, 46 days, and 49 days, respectively.Short-Term Debt. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, short-term debt was $29 and $38, respectively. These amounts included $29 and $33 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to accounts payable settlement arrangements with certain vendors and third-party intermediaries. These arrangements provide that, at the vendor’s request, the third-party intermediary advances the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropriate discount, before the scheduled payment date and Arconic makes payment to the third-party intermediary on the date stipulated in accordance with the commercial terms negotiated with its vendors. Arconic records imputed interest related to these arrangements in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.Commercial Paper. Arconic had no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2018 and 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the average outstanding commercial paper was $49 and $67, respectively. Commercial paper matures at various times within one year and had an annual weighted average interest rate of 2.5%, 1.6%, and 1.1% during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.94Table of ContentsQ.

The transaction has been accounted for as a deferred gain due to continuing involvement. See Note T.R. Other Financial InstrumentsFair Value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (ii) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:•Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.•Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.The carrying values of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Derivatives, Noncurrent receivables and Short-term debt included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. The Company holds exchange-traded fixed income securities which are considered available-for-sale securities that are carried at fair value which is based on quoted market prices which are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of Long-term debt, less amount due within one year was based on quoted market prices for public debt and on interest rates that are currently available to Arconic for issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities for non-public debt. The fair value amounts for all Long-term debt were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 2018 2017December 31,Carryingvalue Fairvalue Carryingvalue FairvalueLong-term debt, less amount due within one year5,896 5,873 6,806 7,443S.

These amounts were included in Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.Noncash Financing and Investing Activities. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction (see Note I).In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks for the remaining portion of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest (see Note P).On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split (see Note I). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the Company’s Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively.In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 76 million shares (see Note I). As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, in the Company’s Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity at December 31, 2016, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares.T. Acquisitions and Divestitures2018 Divestitures. On April 2, 2018, Arconic completed the sale of its Latin America extrusions business to a subsidiary of Hydro Extruded Solutions AS for $2, following the settlement of post-closing and other adjustments in December 2018. As a result of entering into the agreement to sell the Latin America extrusions business in December 2017, a charge of $41 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations related to the non-cash impairment of the net book value of the business and an additional charge of $2 related to a post-closing adjustment was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. The operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. This business generated sales of $25, $115, and $103 in 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively, and had 612 employees at the time of the divestiture.On July 31, 2018, the Company announced that it had initiated a sale process of its Building and Construction Systems (BCS) business, as part of the Company’s ongoing strategy and portfolio review that commenced in January 2018. BCS is part of the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and generated third-party sales of approximately $1,140, $1,070, and $1,010 for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The sale process continues to progress. The Company’s decision regarding whether to sell the business will not be finalized until final binding offers are evaluated at a later stage in the sale process. Until the Company makes that final decision, the BCS business will remain classified as held and in-use in the Consolidated Financial Statements.On October 31, 2018, the Company sold its Texarkana, Texas rolling mill and cast house, which had a combined net book value of $63, to Ta Chen International, Inc. for $302 in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, plus additional contingent consideration of up to $50. The contingent consideration relates to the achievement of various milestones within 36 months of the transaction closing date associated with operationalizing the rolling mill equipment. The operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The Texarkana rolling mill facility had previously been idle since late 2009. In early 2016, the Company restarted the Texarkana cast house to meet demand for aluminum slab. As part of the agreement, the Company will continue to produce aluminum slab at the facility for a period of 18 months through a lease back of the cast house building and equipment, after which time, Ta Chen will perform toll processing of metal for the Company for a period of six months. The Company will supply Ta Chen with cold-rolled aluminum coil during this 24-month period.The sale of the rolling mill and cast house has been accounted for separately. The gain on the sale of the rolling mill of $154, including the fair value of contingent consideration of $5, was recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company will reevaluate its estimate of the amount of contingent consideration to which it will be entitled at the end of each reporting period and recognize any changes thereto in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Company has continuing involvement related to the lease back of the cast house, and, therefore has deferred the gain associated with the cast house in 2018. As a result, the Company continues to treat the cast house building and equipment that it sold to Ta Chen as owned and therefore reflected these assets in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and has been depreciating them over their remaining useful life. Additionally, the Company recorded the cash proceeds associated with the sale of the cast house assets as a noncurrent liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheet which included a deferred gain of $95. The Company will adopt the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter of 2019, under which the 96Table of ContentsCompany's continuing involvement no longer requires deferral of the cast house gain. As such, the deferred gain on the sale of the cast house will be treated as a cumulative effect of an accounting change within retained earnings on January 1, 2019.On December 31, 2018, as part of the Company’s ongoing strategy and portfolio review, Arconic completed the sale of its Eger, Hungary forgings business to Angstrom Automotive Group LLC for $2, which resulted in a loss of $43 recorded in Restructuring and other charges in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The operating results and assets and liabilities of the business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. This business generated sales of $32, $38, and $29 in 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively, and had 180 employees at the time of the divestiture.2017 Divestitures. In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its Fusina, Italy rolling mill to Slim Aluminium. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. As part of the transaction, Arconic injected $10 of cash into the business and provided a third-party guarantee with a fair value of $5 related to Slim Aluminium’s environmental remediation. The Company recorded a loss on the sale of $60, which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations for 2017. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $54 and $165 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the time of the divestiture, the rolling mill had approximately 312 employees.2016 Divestitures. In April 2016, Arconic completed the sale of the Remmele Medical business to LISI MEDICAL for $102 in cash ($99 net of transaction costs), which was included in Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This business, which was part of the RTI acquisition in 2015, manufactured precision-machined metal products for customers in the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets. Since this transaction occurred within a year of the completion of the RTI acquisition, no gain was recorded on this transaction as the excess of the proceeds over the carrying value of the net assets of this business was reflected as a purchase price adjustment (decrease to goodwill of $44) to the final allocation of the purchase price related to Arconic’s acquisition of RTI. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. This business generated sales of approximately $20 from January 1, 2016 through the divestiture date, April 29, 2016, and, at the time of the divestiture, had approximately 330 employees. 2014 Acquisitions. In November 2014, Arconic acquired Firth Rixson. The purchase price included an earn-out agreement that required Arconic to make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through December 31, 2020 upon certain conditions. This earn-out was contingent on the Firth Rixson forging business in Savannah, Georgia achieving certain identified financial targets through December 31, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2016, management determined that payment of the maximum amount was not probable based on the forecasted financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $56 with a corresponding credit to Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, management determined that payment of the remaining amount of the contingent liability was not probable based on the forecasted financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $81 to zero at December 31, 2017 with a corresponding credit to Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The fair value of this liability remains at zero at December 31, 2018 based on the forecasted financial performance of this location.U. Contingencies and CommitmentsContingenciesEnvironmental Matters. Arconic participates in environmental assessments and cleanups at more than 100 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites.A liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs. The liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, and technological changes, among others.Arconic’s remediation reserve balance was $266 at December 31, 2018 and $294 at December 31, 2017 (of which $81 and $41, respectively, was classified as a current liability), and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. In 2018, the Company has seen higher expenditures with the start of construction related to the Grasse River project. Arconic expects that trend to continue for 2019 as reflected by the increase in the portion of the reserve that is considered a current liability. Payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were $32 in 2018 and $26 in 2017 and includes expenditures currently mandated, as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party.Included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs. 97Table of ContentsThese costs are estimated to be approximately 1% or less of cost of goods sold.The following discussion provides details regarding the current status of the most significant remediation reserves related to a current Arconic site.Massena West, NY—Arconic has an ongoing remediation project related to the Grasse River, which is adjacent to Arconic’s Massena plant site. Many years ago, it was determined that sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The project, which was selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a Record of Decision issued in April 2013, is aimed at capping PCB contaminated sediments with concentration in excess of one part per million in the main channel of the river and dredging PCB contaminated sediments in the near-shore areas where total PCBs exceed one part per million. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the reserve balance associated with this matter was $198 and $215, respectively. Arconic is in the planning and design phase of the project, which is expected to be completed early in 2019. Following EPA’s approval of the final design, the actual remediation fieldwork is expected to commence and take approximately four years. The majority of the expenditures related to the project are expected to be incurred between 2019 and 2022.Tax. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement entered into between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the separation transaction with Alcoa Corporation, Arconic shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify Arconic for 49% of the ultimate liability, with respect to the following matter.As previously reported, in July 2013, following a Spanish corporate income tax audit covering the 2006 through 2009 tax years, an assessment was received mainly disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. Arconic filed another appeal in Spain’s National Court in March 2015 which was denied in July 2018. The National Court’s decision requires the assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years to be reissued to take into account the outcome of the 2003 to 2005 audit which was closed in 2017. The Company estimates the revised assessment to be $174 (€152), including interest.The Company has petitioned to the Supreme Court of Spain to review the National Court’s decision. If the petition is accepted, the Supreme Court will review the assessment on its merits and render a final decision. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in appealing the assessment to the Supreme Court of Spain, a portion of the assessment may be offset with existing net operating losses and tax credits available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement. As a result of the National Court decision, an income tax reserve, including interest, of $60 (€52) was established in 2018. Concurrent with the establishment of the reserve, an indemnification receivable of $29 (€25), representing Alcoa Corporation’s 49% share of the liability, was also recorded in 2018.Additionally, while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit, it is possible that the Company may receive assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013. Any potential assessment for an individual tax year is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated operations.Reynobond PE. As previously reported, on June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, UK caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic, Arconic Architectural Products SAS (AAP SAS), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metro Police, a Public Inquiry by the British government and a consumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. AAP SAS has sought and received core participant status in the Public Inquiry. The Company will no longer sell the PE product for architectural use on buildings.Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al. As previously reported, a purported class action complaint related to the Grenfell Tower fire was filed on August 11, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against Arconic Inc. and Klaus Kleinfeld. A related purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on August 25, 2017, under the caption Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al., against Arconic Inc., two former Arconic executives, several current and former Arconic directors, and banks that acted as underwriters for Arconic’s September 18, 2014 preferred stock offering (the “Preferred Offering”). The plaintiff in Sullivan had previously filed a purported class action against the same defendants on July 18, 2017 in the Southern District of New York and, on August 25, 2017, voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice. On February 7, 2018, on motion from certain putative class members, the court consolidated Howard and Sullivan, closed Sullivan, and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case. On April 9, 2018, the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated purported class action filed a consolidated amended complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that the registration statement for the Preferred Offering contained false and misleading statements and 98Table of Contentsomitted to state material information, including by allegedly failing to disclose material uncertainties and trends resulting from sales of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses and by allegedly expressing a belief that appropriate risk management and compliance programs had been adopted while concealing the risks posed by Reynobond PE sales. The consolidated amended complaint also alleges that between November 4, 2013 and June 23, 2017 Arconic and Kleinfeld made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information about the Company’s commitment to safety, business and financial prospects, and the risks of the Reynobond PE product, including in Arconic’s Form 10-Ks for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, its Form 10-Qs and quarterly financial press releases from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2017, its 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Annual Reports, and its 2016 Annual Highlights Report. The consolidated amended complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On June 8, 2018, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint for failure to state a claim. Briefing on that motion is now closed and the parties await a ruling.Raul v. Albaugh, et al. As previously reported, on June 22, 2018, a derivative complaint was filed nominally on behalf of Arconic by a purported Arconic shareholder against all current members of Arconic’s Board of Directors, Klaus Kleinfeld and Ken Giacobbe, naming Arconic as a nominal defendant, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint raises similar allegations as the consolidated amended complaint in Howard, as well as allegations that the defendants improperly authorized the sale of Reynobond PE for unsafe uses, and asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Delaware state law. On July 13, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to stay this case until the final resolution of the Howard case, the Grenfell Tower public inquiry in London, and the investigation by the London Metropolitan Police Service and on June 23, 2018, the Court approved the stay.While the Company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. Given the preliminary nature of these matters and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. The Board of Directors has also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of shareholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board authorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board and others. The Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee of the Board to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to these shareholder demand letters. The Special Litigation Committee and the Board are continuing to consider the appropriate responses to the shareholder demand letters in view of developments in proceedings concerning the Grenfell Tower fire.Other. In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, tax and antitrust matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.CommitmentsPurchase Obligations. Arconic has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, energy and other goods and services, which total $770 in 2019, $169 in 2020, $27 in 2021, $24 in 2022, $8 in 2023, and $5 thereafter.Operating Leases. Certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment are under operating lease agreements. Total expense for all leases was $144 in 2018, $113 in 2017, and $110 in 2016. Under long-term operating leases, minimum annual rentals are $94 in 2019, $74 in 2020, $54 in 2021, $40 in 2022, $30 in 2023, and $87 thereafter.Guarantees. At December 31, 2018, Arconic had outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2019 and 2026 was $37 at December 31, 2018.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $6 and $8 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Arconic was required to provide payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party related to project financing for Alcoa Corporation’s aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. During the third quarter of 2018, Arconic was released from this guarantee. Furthermore, Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant 99Table of ContentsGeneration Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee. For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,087 and $1,297 at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. This guarantee expires in 2047. For this guarantee, subject to its provisions, Arconic is secondarily liable in the event of a payment default by Alcoa Corporation. Arconic currently views the risk of an Alcoa Corporation payment default on its obligations under the contract to be remote.In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one-year claims purchase agreement with a bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium was paid by Alcoa Corporation. The agreement matured in December 2017 and was not renewed in 2018 due to the decline in exposure to guarantee claims including a substantial reduction in the guarantees related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and also the elimination of the guarantee related to the Rockdale energy contract. In December 2018, Arconic entered into a one-year insurance policy with a limit of $80 relating to the remaining long-term energy supply agreement. The premium is expected to be paid by Alcoa Corporation. The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement or insurance policy will be made on an annual basis going forward.Letters of Credit. Arconic has outstanding letters of credit, primarily related to workers’ compensation, environmental obligations and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2019, was $136 at December 31, 2018.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $54 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.Surety Bonds. Arconic has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these surety bonds, which expire at various dates, primarily in 2019, was $50 at December 31, 2018.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $25 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionately billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.V. Separation Transaction and Discontinued OperationsOn November 1, 2016, Arconic completed the Separation Transaction. Alcoa Inc., which was re-named Arconic Inc., continues to own the Global Rolled Products (except for the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia), Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation includes the Alumina and Primary Metals segments and the aforementioned Warrick, IN rolling operations and equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were formally part of the Global Rolled Products segment.Arconic completed the Separation Transaction by distribution on November 1, 2016 of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to the Company’s shareholders of record (the “Distribution”) as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”). Arconic retained 19.9% of the Alcoa Corporation common stock (36,311,767 shares). In the Distribution, each Company shareholder received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of Arconic common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. Shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock. The Company had recorded the retained interest as a cost method investment in Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the December 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation was $1,020 at December 31, 2016 and was based on the closing stock price of Alcoa Corporation as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by the number of shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock owned by the Company at that date.In February 2017, Arconic sold 23,353,000 of its shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock at $38.03 per share, which resulted in cash proceeds of $888 which were recorded in Sales of investments within Investing Activities in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, and a gain of $351 which was recorded in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. In April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the “Investment Banks”) in exchange for cash and the Company’s remaining 12,958,767 Alcoa Corporation shares (valued at $35.91 per share) (the “Debt-for-Equity Exchange”) (See Note P). A gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange was recorded in Other expense (income), net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of May 4, 2017, the Company no longer maintained a retained interest in Alcoa Corporation 100Table of Contentscommon stock.On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement (the “Toll Processing Agreement”), Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.Effective November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon completion of the Separation Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic provided a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the end date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation supplied all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic processed the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenues for 2018, 2017, and the two-month period ended December 31, 2016 and accounts receivable at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 were not material to the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to provide maximum potential future payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, guarantees related to two long-term Alcoa Corporation energy supply agreements, guarantees related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities and energy supply contracts, letters of credit and surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016, and letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts (see Note U).As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic had recorded a receivable in the December 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet for the net after-tax proceeds from Alcoa Corporation’s sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project. The transaction closed and the Company received proceeds of $238 in the first quarter of 2017 and the remaining $5 in the second quarter of 2017. The $243 proceeds were included in Other within Investing Activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.The results of operations of Alcoa Corporation were presented as discontinued operations in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as summarized below (the amounts presented in the table below have not been recast to reflect the adoption of new guidance issued by the FASB related to the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost as detailed in Note A): Ten monthsended October 31,  2016Sales$6,752Cost of goods sold (exclusive of expenses below)5,655Selling, general administrative, and other expenses164Research and development28Provision for depreciation, depletion and amortization593Restructuring and other charges102Interest expense28Other (income) expenses, net(75)Income from discontinued operations before income taxes257Provision for income taxes73Income from discontinued operations after income taxes184Less: Net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests63Net income from discontinued operations$121During 2017 and 2016, Arconic recognized $18 ($12 after-tax) and $193 ($158 after-tax), respectively, in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for costs related to the Separation Transaction. In addition, Arconic also incurred capital expenditures and debt issuance costs of $110 during 2016 related to the Separation Transaction. None of the aforementioned costs and expenses related to the Separation Transaction were reclassified into discontinued operations.101Table of ContentsOn November 1, 2016, management evaluated the net assets of Alcoa Corporation for potential impairment and determined that no impairment charge was required.The cash flows related to Alcoa Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for 2016. The following table presents depreciation, depletion and amortization, restructuring and other charges, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of the discontinued operations related to Alcoa Corporation:For the year ended December 31,2016Depreciation, depletion and amortization$593Restructuring and other charges$102Capital expenditures$298W. Subsequent EventsManagement evaluated all activity of Arconic and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, except as noted below:On January 22, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board) had determined to no longer pursue a potential sale of Arconic as part of its strategy and portfolio review.On February 6, 2019, the Company announced that the Board appointed John C. Plant, current Chairman of the Board, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective February 6, 2019, to succeed Chip Blankenship, who ceased to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and resigned as a member of the Board, in each case as of that date. In addition, the Company announced that the Board appointed Elmer L. Doty, current member of the Board, as President and Chief Operating Officer, a newly created position, effective February 6, 2019. Mr. Doty will remain a member of the Board. The Company also announced that Arthur D. Collins, Jr., current member of the Board, has been appointed interim Lead Independent Director of the Company, effective February 6, 2019.On February 8, 2019, the Company announced the following key initiatives as part of its ongoing strategy and portfolio review: plans to reduce operating costs, designed to maximize the impact in 2019; the planned separation of its portfolio into Engineered Products and Forgings (EP&F) and Global Rolled Products (GRP), with a spin-off of one of the businesses; the potential sale of businesses that do not best fit into EP&F or GRP; execute its previously authorized $500 share repurchase program in the first half of 2019; the Board authorized an additional $500 of share repurchases, effective through the end of 2020; and plans to reduce its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.06 to $0.02 per share.On February 19, 2019, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank to repurchase $700 of its common stock, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board. Under the ASR agreement, Arconic will receive initial delivery of approximately 32 million shares on February 21, 2019. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of Arconic’s common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount. The ASR agreement is expected to be completed during the first half of 2019.The Company will evaluate its organizational structure in conjunction with the planned separation of its portfolio and changes to its reportable segments are expected in the first half of 2019. 102Table of ContentsSupplemental Financial Information (unaudited)Quarterly Data(in millions, except per-share amounts)  FirstSecondThirdFourth(2)Year2018     Sales$3,445$3,573$3,524$3,472$14,014Net income$143$120$161$218$642Earnings per share attributable to Arconic common shareholders(1):     Basic     Net income per share—basic$0.30$0.25$0.33$0.45$1.33Diluted     Net income per share—diluted$0.29$0.24$0.32$0.44$1.302017     Sales$3,192$3,261$3,236$3,271$12,960Net income (loss)$322$212$119$(727)$(74)Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Arconic common shareholders(1):     Basic     Net income (loss) per share—basic$0.69$0.44$0.23$(1.51)$(0.28)Diluted     Net income (loss) per share—basic$0.65$0.43$0.22$(1.51)$(0.28)(1) Per share amounts are calculated independently for each period presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal the per share amounts for the year.(2) In the fourth quarter of 2018, Arconic recorded a gain of $119 ($154 pre-tax) on the sale of the Texarkana rolling mill, offset by pension plan settlement charges of $72 ($92 pre-tax) associated with significant lump sum payments made to participants and a loss of $39 ($43 pre-tax) on the sale of the Eger, Hungary forgings business.

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing Arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Arconic or that Arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company in future periods.The markets for Arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.Arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation and construction industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control.In particular, Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators, the retirement of older aircraft, and 15Table of Contentstechnological improvements to new engines. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines.Further, the demand for Arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive manufacturers and Arconic content per vehicle. The automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions, including credit markets and interest rates, and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage, vehicle size, configuration and features. Automotive sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and levels of competition.While Arconic believes that the long-term prospects for its products are positive, the Company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government intervention. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.As discussed in Part I, Item 1. (Business-Competitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for Arconic’s products are highly competitive. Arconic’s competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. New product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace Arconic products. The willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Arconic, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for Arconic’s products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Arconic’s competitors or customers could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully.Arconic’s competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to:•identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in Arconic’s target end-markets;•identify and successfully execute on a strategy to remain an essential and sustainable element of its customer’s supply chain; •fund, develop, manufacture and bring innovative new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively;•monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers’ and competitors’ abilities to deploy those disruptive technologies; and•achieve sufficient return on investment for new products based on capital expenditures and research and development spending.Arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments, including additive manufacturing, alloy development, engineered finishes and product design, high speed continuous casting and rolling technology, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. For more information on Arconic’s research and development programs, see “Research and Development” in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report.While Arconic intends to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors, including those developing technology to displace Arconic’s current products. In addition, Arconic may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages. There can be no assurance that any of Arconic’s new products or services, development programs or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Arconic.Arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers.A significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer or customers supplied by Arconic could affect Arconic’s financial results in a particular period. Arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other 16Table of Contentsdifficulties in their businesses. Arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Arconic, including to reduce the amount of Arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers. If Arconic is unsuccessful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected.Arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety, which could affect Arconic’s reputation, business and financial statements.The manufacture of many of Arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols, specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, problems with raw materials, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, labor unrest and environmental factors. Such problems could have an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product quality or performance. Product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure, including if any of our products are defective or are used in a manner that results in injuries or other damages. Because of approval and license requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to the Company or its customers. Accordingly, manufacturing problems, product defects or other risks associated with our products, including their use or application, could result in significant costs to and liability for Arconic that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations, including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages, fines or penalties, as well as negative publicity and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Arconic’s business depends, in part, on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations, reductions and delays.Arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation and military aircraft programs and is the sole supplier of aluminum sheet for a number of aluminum-intensive automotive vehicle programs. Many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years. If Arconic fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, program cancellations, reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business.Arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending.Arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft and armored vehicles. Although many of the programs in which Arconic participates extend several years, they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations. Changes in military strategy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for Arconic’s products, which could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic’s global operations expose the Company to risks that could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia. As a result, the Company’s global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which Arconic does business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, including:•economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings;•geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements;•war or terrorist activities;•major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, or the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Arconic’s operations or workforce;•difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; 17Table of Contents•changes in trade and tax laws that may result in our customers being subjected to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and reduce their willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products;•rising labor costs;•labor unrest, including strikes;•compliance with antitrust and competition regulations; •compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. laws;•aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by national governmental authorities;•compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-bribery and corruption laws;•compliance with U.S. laws concerning trade, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (“OFAC”); •imposition of currency controls;•adverse tax audit rulings; and•unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.Although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. While Arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management, compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the risks associated with these factors, such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs or liabilities that may arise from such events. Arconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business and competitive position.Arconic owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining Arconic’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Arconic’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Arconic’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents Arconic owns or licenses. The pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of such intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. Further, as the Company expands its operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of Arconic intellectual property increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against Arconic relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce these rights sufficiently, could adversely affect Arconic’s business and competitive position.Arconic may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic alliances.Arconic has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio. Although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to Arconic, there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company, unanticipated costs and liabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. The Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. Additionally, adverse factors may prevent Arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines.With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, Arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders. In addition, Arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Arconic’s business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures.18Table of ContentsIn addition, Arconic has participated in, and may continue to participate in, joint ventures, strategic alliances and other similar arrangements from time to time. Although the Company has, in connection with past and existing joint ventures, sought to protect its interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not Arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may:•have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Company;•exercise veto rights to block actions that Arconic believes to be in its or the joint venture’s or strategic alliance’s best interests; •take action contrary to Arconic’s policies or objectives with respect to investments; or•as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.There can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures, closures, joint ventures, strategic alliances or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to Arconic, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other factors.Arconic may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business segments, at the levels or by the dates targeted.From time to time, Arconic may announce future targets or goals for its business, which are based on the Company’s then current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which Arconic operates. Future targets and goals reflect the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends, then current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. As such, targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. The actual outcome may be materially different. There can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the Company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all. Failure to achieve the targets or goals by the Company may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.Cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Arconic’s intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Arconic faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches.The Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Arconic’s financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and result in the diminution of the value of the Company’s investment in research and development.A decline in Arconic’s financial performance or outlook could negatively impact the Company’s access to the global capital markets, reduce the Company’s liquidity and increase its borrowing costs.Arconic has significant capital requirements and depends, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic acquisitions. A decline in the Company’s financial performance or outlook 19Table of Contentsdue to internal or external factors could affect the Company’s access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that Arconic will have access to the global capital market on terms the Company finds acceptable. Limitations on Arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in the Company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.A downgrade of Arconic’s credit ratings could limit Arconic’s ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of its securities, trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.Arconic’s credit ratings are important to the Company’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate Arconic’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to the Company. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3. On November 1, 2016, Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) downgraded Arconic’s long-term debt rating from Ba1, a non-investment grade, to Ba2 and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade Liquidity-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2. Additionally, Moody’s changed the outlook from negative to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on November 2, 2017). On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the current outlook from evolving to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on July 3, 2017).There can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to Arconic’s ratings. Increased debt levels, macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Company’s debt protection metrics, a contraction in the Company’s liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.A downgrade of Arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of Arconic’s securities; adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by Standard and Poor’s or a further downgrade by Moody’s would subject Arconic to higher costs under Arconic’s Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities); limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs; increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities; result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Arconic; or otherwise impair Arconic’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.Arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Arconic’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Arconic’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Company’s position in relation to its competitors.An adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect Arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.Arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. Arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity. For a discussion regarding how Arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7. (Management’s Discussion 20Table of Contentsand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Arconic would contribute to the pension plans.Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) was signed into law. HATFA extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law. BBA 2015 extends the relief period provided by HAFTA. Arconic believes that the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Company’s U.S. pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Company’s cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Company’s liabilities related to such plans, which could adversely affect Arconic’s liquidity and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in Arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Arconic’s future profitability.Arconic is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Company’s tax expense and profitability. Arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.Corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. In particular, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) was signed into law, significantly reforming the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company continues to review the components of the 2017 Act and evaluate its consequences. As such, the ultimate impact of the 2017 Act may differ from reported amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made; guidance that may be issued; and actions the Company may take as a result of the 2017 Act. The changes to the U.S. corporate tax system resulting from the 2017 Act could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on Arconic’s future effective tax rate, cash tax expenditures, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.Arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum.Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminum-based products. The price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable. Although the Company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the Company’s customers, Arconic may be unable to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there can be a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the Company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers. As a result, Arconic may be exposed to such price fluctuations during the time lag. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates.Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which Arconic operates, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and 21Table of Contentsfinancial environment could affect Arconic’s revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, including the Euro, British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and Russian ruble, may affect Arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while the Company’s products are generally sold in U.S. dollars.Arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.Arconic has undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including deployment of company-wide business process models, such as Arconic’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and overhead cost reductions. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to Arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. If Arconic fails to achieve net cost savings at anticipated levels, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.Arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials.Certain applications of Arconic’s aluminum-based products compete with products made from other materials, such as steel, titanium and composites. The willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes. For example, the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum, such as titanium and composites, in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft. Additionally, the automotive industry, while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum, may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications. Further, the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices. The willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of Arconic’s products, and thus adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Arconic’s profitability could be adversely affected by volatility in the availability or cost of raw materials.Arconic’s results of operations may be affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials (e.g., aluminum, nickel, titanium dioxide), as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government entities, changes in world politics or regulatory requirements, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, sanctions, new or increased import duties, countervailing or anti-dumping duties, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. In addition, from time to time, commodity prices may fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve, which may cause periodic supply interruptions. Arconic may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s operating results.Union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.A significant portion of Arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see “Employees” in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report. While Arconic was previously successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions, Arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Arconic’s facilities in the future. Arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business, financial condition or results of operations.A failure to attract, retain or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect Arconic’s operations and competitiveness.Arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience. The inability of the Company to attract and retain such people may adversely impact Arconic’s ability to meet project demands adequately and fill roles in existing operations. Skills shortages in engineering, manufacturing, technology, construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities. These shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations.22Table of ContentsIn addition, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the Company’s growth and business strategy. The loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm Arconic’s business, and any unplanned turnover, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions, could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base, delay or impede the execution of the Company’s business plans and erode Arconic’s competitiveness.Arconic may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.Arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Arconic. The Company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. The Company is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks associated with its business and products. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, health and safety, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, government contracts and taxes, as well as compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations governing export, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, sales and trading practices, and the manufacture and sale of products. Arconic could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.For example, in the event that an Arconic product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, Arconic may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. In addition, if an Arconic product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, sales of the Company’s products could be diminished, and the Company could be subject to further liability claims. Even if Arconic successfully defends against these types of claims, the Company could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims; the Company’s management could be required to devote significant time, attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims; and Arconic’s reputation could suffer, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.While Arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise. The global and diverse nature of Arconic’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, see the discussion in Part I, Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).Arconic is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.Arconic’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, where no problem is currently known, at previously owned sites, sites previously operated by the Company, sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations may prove to be more challenging and costly than the Company anticipates. For example, new data and information, including information about the ways in which the Company’s products are used, may lead the Company, regulatory authorities, government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations, or impose restrictions, related to the manufacturing or use of the Company’s products. This could lead to 23Table of Contentsreduced sales or market acceptance of the Company’s products. Arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Arconic is subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR’), which will become effective in May 2018, imposes significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the GDRP or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.Arconic may be subject to securities litigation, which could cause the Company to incur substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.Arconic currently is, and may in the future become, subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws. Arconic is generally obliged, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify its current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits. Regardless of the outcome, securities litigation may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s business results.Arconic is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), state and local wage laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), and regulations related to safety, discrimination, organizing, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments, citizenship requirements, and healthcare insurance mandates. Allegations that Arconic has violated such laws or regulations could damage the Company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which could have a material adverse impact on Arconic’s operations and financial condition.Arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.Increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems and additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases. New laws enacted could directly and indirectly affect Arconic’s customers and suppliers (through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products) or business (through an impact on Arconic’s inventory availability, cost of sales, operations or demand for Arconic products), which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company or its customers or suppliers. Also, Arconic relies on natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities. Any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the Company and its customers and suppliers, which could also have a negative impact on Arconic’s profitability.Anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Arconic, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of Arconic’s shareholders.Arconic’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Arconic’s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Arconic is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Arconic. Additionally, the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes Arconic’s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other 24Table of Contentsanti-takeover measures without shareholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Arconic’s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Arconic common stock, or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.Dividends on Arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances.The existence, timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to Arconic’s shareholders falls within the discretion of Arconic’s Board of Directors. The Arconic Board of Director’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Arconic’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Company’s debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that Arconic’s Board of Directors deems relevant. Arconic’s Board of Directors may determine to reduce or eliminate Arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions or in other circumstances.Changes in the United Kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect Arconic.In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (also referred to as “Brexit”). The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic are difficult to predict, but because the Company currently operates and conducts business in the United Kingdom and in Europe, the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to Arconic’s businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with Arconic’s customers and suppliers, as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies, including the value of the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect Arconic’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the United Kingdom and the European Union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.Arconic may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect Arconic’s business.Arconic may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) enabling the management of each company to pursue more effectively its own distinct operating priorities and strategies, to focus on strengthening its core business and its unique needs, and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for long-term growth and profitability; (ii) permitting each company to allocate its financial resources to meet the unique needs of its own business, allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to pursue more effectively its own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies; (iii) allowing each company to articulate more effectively a clear investment thesis to attract a long-term investor base suited to its business and providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities; (iv) creating an independent equity currency tracking each company’s underlying business, affording Arconic and Alcoa Corporation direct access to the capital markets and facilitating each company’s ability to consummate future acquisitions or other restructuring transactions utilizing its common stock; (v) allowing each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets, due to the common nature of the underlying businesses; and (vi) separating and simplifying the structures required to manage two distinct and differing underlying businesses.Arconic may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) Arconic may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if Alcoa Corporation were still a part of the Company because Arconic’s business is less diversified than it was prior to the completion of the Separation; and (ii) as a smaller, independent company, Arconic may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those it obtained prior to completion of the Separation. If Arconic fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on Arconic’s competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.25Table of ContentsAlcoa Corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation.In connection with the Separation, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and also entered into various other agreements, including a Tax Matters Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, intellectual property license agreements, a metal supply agreement, real estate and office leases, a spare parts loan agreement and an agreement relating to the North American packaging business. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the Company prior to the Separation was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. Arconic will rely on Alcoa Corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Alcoa Corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.In connection with the Separation, Alcoa Corporation has agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities and Arconic has agreed to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities. If Arconic is required to pay under these indemnities to Alcoa Corporation, Arconic’s financial results could be negatively impacted. The Alcoa Corporation indemnity may be insufficient to hold Arconic harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Alcoa Corporation will be allocated responsibility, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation has agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities, and Arconic has agreed to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that Arconic may be required to provide Alcoa Corporation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact Arconic’s business. Third parties could also seek to hold Arconic responsible for any of the liabilities that Alcoa Corporation has agreed to retain. Any amounts Arconic is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require Arconic to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the Company’s operating business. Further, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Arconic against the full amount of such liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable, Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Arconic’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Separation could result in substantial tax liability.It was a condition to the Distribution that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and the Distribution received by Arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to Arconic’s Board of Directors and (ii) Arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the Distribution. However, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Arconic or Alcoa Corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation- related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.Notwithstanding Arconic’s receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Arconic of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the 26Table of Contentsevent the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Arconic, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic shareholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.If the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Arconic shareholders who received Alcoa Corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.Under current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution may nevertheless be rendered taxable to Arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain post-Distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of Arconic or Alcoa Corporation. The possibility of rendering the Distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit Arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of Arconic’s business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation may be required to indemnify Arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of Alcoa Corporation stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing actively to conduct certain of its businesses, (v) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa Corporation or (vi) any of Alcoa Corporation’s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable, Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, Arconic and Arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect Arconic’s business, results of operations and financial condition.",>Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments.None.,">Item 2. Properties.Arconic’s principal office is located at 390 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022-4608. Arconic’s corporate center is located at 201 Isabella Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. The Arconic Technology Center for research and development is located at 100 Technical Drive, New Kensington, Pennsylvania 15069-0001.Arconic leases some of its facilities; however, it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or the properties’ values.Arconic believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of properties owned by Arconic has been made for the purpose of this report, the Company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties. See Notes A and H to the financial statements for information on properties, plants and equipment.Arconic has active plants and holdings under the following segments and in the following geographic areas:ENGINEERED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONSSee the table and related text in the Engineered Products and Solutions Facilities section on page 6 of this report.GLOBAL ROLLED PRODUCTSSee the table and related text in the Global Rolled Products Facilities section on page 8 of this report.TRANSPORTATION AND CONSTRUCTION SOLUTIONSSee the table and related text in the Transportation and Construction Solutions section on page 9 of this report.27Table of Contents",">Item 3. Legal Proceedings.In the ordinary course of its business, Arconic is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential.Environmental MattersArconic is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA) or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The Company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites. The most significant of these matters, the remediation of the Grasse River in Massena, NY, is discussed in the Environmental Matters section of Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Environmental Matters” on page 84.As previously reported, on June 21, 2017, the UK Environment Agency (the “Agency”) confirmed that it will prosecute Firth Rixson Metals Limited in Chesterfield (UK) Magistrates Court in relation to an environmental incident that took place on April 22, 2015 at the Company’s Glossop UK site. It is alleged that an acid scrubber unit at the site caused a leak into the local river resulting in environmental damage, including the death of approximately 200 fish. Arconic was not successful in persuading the Agency to drop the prosecution in lieu of an enforcement undertaking (a civil remedy) despite the fact that cyanide, a compound not used on the site, had been identified in the samples of water taken at the time. A hearing before the Court was held on September 13, 2017 at which Firth Rixson pled guilty to the underlying offense of allowing a release to occur to the nearby stream.  A follow-up hearing was held on December 6, 2017 at which the Court accepted Firth Rixson’s guilty plea.  The Court categorized the Company’s level of culpability as negligent and the level of harm to the environment as level 2 (on a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 being the most serious). The Court fined Firth Rixson £80,000 (converted to approximately $108,355) plus costs of approximately £19,000 (converted to $25,734).  The Company paid the fine and costs and accordingly, this matter is now closed and no further reports will be made.Reynobond PEAs previously reported, on June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, UK caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic, Arconic Architectural Products SAS (AAP SAS), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metro Police, a Public Inquiry by the British government and a consumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. AAP SAS has sought and received core participant status in the Public Inquiry. The Company will no longer sell the PE product for architectural use on buildings.Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al. A purported class action complaint was filed on July 18, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Arconic Inc., as well as two former Arconic executives and several current and former Arconic directors, and banks that acted as underwriters for Arconic’s September 18, 2014 preferred stock offering. The complaint alleges that statements in the registration statement for Arconic’s September 18, 2014 preferred stock offering were false and misleading in light of the subsequent Grenfell Tower fire. The complaint also alleges that Arconic’s failure to disclose at the time of the offering that it was obtaining significant profits through sales that exposed it to substantial liability violated the federal securities laws. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory and rescissory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On August 25, 2017, this case was dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice and re-filed on September 15, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On February 7, 2018, on motion from certain putative class members, the court consolidated Sullivan and Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al., another case pending in the Western District of Pennsylvania (described below), and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case.Howard v. Arconic Inc. et al. A purported class action complaint was filed on August 11, 2017 in the United States District Court for Western District of Pennsylvania against Arconic Inc., and Klaus Kleinfeld. The complaint alleges that Arconic and Mr. Kleinfeld made various false and misleading statements, and omitted to disclose material information, about the Company’s business and financial prospects and, specifically, the risks of the Reynobond PE product. The complaint alleges that the statements in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, its 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Annual Reports, and its 2016 Annual Highlights Report about management’s recognition of its responsibility to conduct the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct and within the laws of the host countries in which it operates, and its failure to disclose that Arconic knowingly supplied highly flammable Reynobond PE cladding panels for use in construction that significantly increased the risk of property damage, injury and death, were false and misleading in violation of the federal securities laws and artificially inflated the prices of Arconic’s 28Table of Contentssecurities. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses. On February 7, 2018, on motion from certain putative class members, the court consolidated Howard and Sullivan v. Arconic Inc. et al., another case pending in the Western District of Pennsylvania (described above), and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case.While the Company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. Given the preliminary nature of these matters and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. The Board of Directors has also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of shareholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board authorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board and others. The Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee of the Board to review these shareholder demand letters and consider the appropriate course of action. In addition, lawsuits are pending in state court in New York and federal court in Pennsylvania, initiated, respectively, by another purported shareholder and by the Company, concerning the shareholder’s claimed right, which the Company contests, to inspect the Company’s books and records related to the Grenfell Tower fire and Reynobond PE.Other MattersAs previously reported, Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury as a result of occupational or other exposure to asbestos. Arconic, its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries have numerous insurance policies over many years that provide coverage for asbestos related claims. Arconic has significant insurance coverage and believes that Arconic’s reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations, cash flows, and financial position of the Company.TaxPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, the Company shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation for, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the Company with respect to, the following matter.As previously reported, in September 2010, following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years, an assessment was received as a result of Spain’s tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. An appeal of this assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court by the Company was denied in October 2013. In December 2013, the Company filed an appeal of the assessment in Spain’s National Court.On January 16, 2017, Spain’s National Court issued a decision in favor of the Company related to the assessment received in September 2010. The Spanish Tax Administration did not file an appeal within the applicable period. Based on this decision and recent confirming correspondence from the Spanish Tax Administration, the matter is now closed. The Company will not be responsible for any assessment related to the 2003 through 2005 tax years.Additionally, following a corporate income tax audit of the same Spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years, Spain’s tax authorities issued an assessment in July 2013, similarly disallowing certain interest deductions. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. The Company filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spain’s National Court in March 2015. Spain’s National Court has not yet rendered a decision related to the assessment received in July 2013. The assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years is $155 million (€130 million), including interest. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through Spain’s court system. However, in the event the Company is unsuccessful, a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement. Additionally, while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit, it is possible that the Company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter.Matters Previously Reported – Alcoa CorporationWe have included the matters discussed below in which the Company remains party to proceedings relating to Alcoa Corporation in accordance with SEC regulations. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, provides for cross-indemnities between 29Table of Contentsthe Company and Alcoa Corporation for claims subject to indemnification. The Company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it.St. Croix ProceedingsAbednego and Abraham cases. As previously reported, on January 14, 2010, Arconic was served with a multi-plaintiff action complaint involving several thousand individual persons claiming to be residents of St. Croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from Hurricane Georges or winds blowing material from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (“SCA”) facility on the island of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) since the time of the hurricane. This complaint, Abednego, et al. v. Alcoa, et al. was filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Arconic and SCA to remove the case to federal court, the case has been lodged in the Superior Court. The complaint names as defendants the same entities that were sued in a February 1999 action arising out of the impact of Hurricane Georges on the island and added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property.Also as previously reported, on March 1, 2012, Arconic was served with a separate multi-plaintiff action complaint involving approximately 200 individual persons alleging claims essentially identical to those set forth in the Abednego v. Alcoa complaint. This complaint, Abraham, et al. v. Alcoa, et al., was filed on behalf of plaintiffs previously dismissed in the federal court proceeding involving the original litigation over Hurricane Georges impacts. The matter was originally filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division, on March 30, 2011.Arconic and other defendants in the Abraham and Abednego cases filed or renewed motions to dismiss each case in March 2012 and August 2012 following service of the Abraham complaint on Arconic and remand of the Abednego complaint to Superior Court, respectively. By order dated August 10, 2015, the Superior Court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaints without prejudice to re-file the complaints individually, rather than as a multi-plaintiff filing. The order also preserves the defendants’ grounds for dismissal if new, individual complaints are filed. On July 7, 2017, the Court issued an order and associated memoranda on plaintiff’s multiple motions for extension of time to file the individual Complaints. Following the court’s July 7, 2017 order, a total of 429 complaints were filed and accepted by the court by the deadline of July 30, 2017 (and consolidated into the Red Dust Claims docket (Master Case No.:  SX-15-CV-620)).  These complaints include claims of about 1,260 individual plaintiffs.  As a result of the devastation caused by two hurricanes, court operations were suspended until very recently.  On December 11, 2017, the court issued a new scheduling order and further set a scheduling conference for January 18, 2018. At that conference, the court set the next status conference for late July 2018.Other ContingenciesIn addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and tax matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company.",>Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.Not applicable.30Table of ContentsPART II,">Item 5.   Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the Separation of Alcoa Corporation from the Company, the Company’s common stock traded under the symbol “AA.” In connection with the separation, on November 1, 2016, the Company changed its stock symbol and its common stock began trading under the symbol “ARNC.”On October 5, 2016, the Company’s common shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding and authorized shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares, and proportionately decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1.8 billion to 0.6 billion shares. The Company’s common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on October 6, 2016.On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the Separation of its business into two independent, publicly traded companies: the Company and Alcoa Corporation. The Separation was effected by means of a pro rata distribution by the Company of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Company’s shareholders. The Company’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company retained 19.9% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Separation. See disposition of retained shares in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices and quarterly dividend amounts per share of the Company’s common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, adjusted to take into account the Reverse Stock Split effected on October 6, 2016. The prices listed below for those dates prior to November 1, 2016 reflect stock trading prices of Alcoa Inc. prior to the Separation of Alcoa Corporation from the Company on November 1, 2016, and therefore are not comparable to the Company’s post-Separation prices.   20172016QuarterHighLowDividendHighLowDividendFirst$30.69$18.64$0.06$30.66$18.42$0.09Second28.6521.760.0634.5026.340.09Third26.8422.670.0632.9127.090.09Fourth (Separation occurred on November 1, 2016)27.8522.740.0632.1016.750.09Year$30.69$18.64$0.24$34.50$16.75$0.36The number of holders of record of common stock was approximately 12,271 as of February 16, 2018.31Table of ContentsStock Performance GraphThe following graph compares the most recent five-year performance of the Company’s common stock with (1) the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index and (2) the Standard & Poor’s 500® Materials Index, a group of 25 companies categorized by Standard & Poor’s as active in the “materials” market sector.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and aluminum prices; shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt])OverviewOur BusinessArconic (“Arconic” or the “Company”) is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications.Arconic is a global company operating in 18 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 63% and 26%, respectively, of Arconic’s sales in 2017. In addition, Arconic has operating activities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia, among others. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.Management Review of 2017 and Outlook for the FutureIn 2017, Arconic’s revenues increased 5% over 2016 as a result of higher volumes across all segments including strong volume growth in our aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets, and higher aluminum pricing primarily impacting the Global Rolled Products segment, partially offset by the planned ramp down and Toll Processing and Services Agreement (the “Toll Processing Agreement”) relating to the Company’s North America packaging business in Tennessee, and unfavorable product pricing and mix.  In the segments, Adjusted EBITDA increased over 2016 as a result of the aforementioned higher volumes and continued focus on net cost savings that more than offset negative factors including product pricing pressures, ramp up costs associated with new aerospace engine parts, aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates, and higher aluminum prices.Loss from continuing operations after income taxes was $74 in 2017 compared to $1,062 in 2016.  There were several significant items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company recorded a charge of $719 ($719 pre-tax) associated with the impairment of goodwill in the forgings and extrusions business and a charge of $41 ($41 pre-tax) for the impairment of assets in the Latin America extrusions business in conjunction with an agreement to sell the business.  Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded income of $97 ($106 pre-tax) associated with the reversal of liabilities for a contingent earn-out and a separation-related guarantee.  The Company was also impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (“the 2017 Act”), and recorded a provisional charge of $272 associated with the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017.  The impact of the 2017 Act provisions will be updated over the course of 2018, in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission which has provided a one-year measurement period to finalize the accounting impacts of the new legislation, and as additional guidance is issued and the new law is further analyzed.Additionally during 2017, the Company disposed of its retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock and recorded gains of $405 ($518 pre-tax), and the Company redeemed debt of $1,250, recording charges of $49 ($76 pre-tax) primarily for the premium paid for the early redemption of the debt.  See discussion that follows under Results of Operations below for further information on 2017 results.Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has also intensified its focus on capital efficiency. This focus and the related results enabled Arconic to end 2017 with a solid financial position.34Table of ContentsThe following financial information reflects certain key measures of Arconic’s 2017 results:•Sales of $12,960 and Net loss of $74, or 0.28 per diluted share;•Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1,761, an increase of 17% from 20161;•Cash from operations of $701;•Capital expenditures of $596;•Cash on hand at the end of the year of $2,150; and•Total debt of $6,844, a decrease in total debt of $1,240 from 2016.(1) For the reconciliation of Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and related information, see page 45.In 2018, management projects that sales will be up 3% to 6% based on volume and share gains, as well as higher aluminum prices. In aerospace, it is anticipated that the favorable impact of share gains on new platforms and engines will be somewhat offset by lower pricing and the mix of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft produced. Management also expects strong growth in automotive sheet and commercial transportation markets, particularly due to North American and European heavy-duty truck production increases, while the industrial gas turbine market will continue declining throughout 2018.Looking ahead over the next year, management will continue to focus on improving operating performance through cost reductions, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. As part of this effort, the Company made the decision to freeze its U.S. defined benefit pension plans for all U.S.-based salaried and non-bargained hourly employees effective April 1, 2018, and the Company intends to relocate its global headquarters by the end of 2018 out of New York City to a more cost-effective location.  Management has initiated a review of the Company’s strategy and portfolio.  Additionally, each of the segments are projected to achieve net cost savings in 2018.   As a result, adjusted earnings per share is anticipated to increase and free cash flow is also expected to improve in 2018 through increased focus on driving operational improvements and working capital efficiency.To further enhance the Company’s financial position and return capital to shareholders, Arconic’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 of its outstanding common stock and a $500 early debt reduction.  Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate.  Repurchases will be subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. For the early debt reduction, Arconic intends to redeem in March 2018 all of its outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company's primary measure of segment performance will change from Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this change, LIFO and metal price lag will be included in the Operating income of the segments.In conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting guidance on changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows (effective January 1, 2018 and to be applied retrospectively), specifically as it relates to the requirement to reclassify cash received from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables from Cash from operations to Cash provided from investing activities, the Company has changed the calculation of its measure of free cash flow to Cash from operations plus cash received from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables, less Capital expenditures.  This change to our measure of free cash flow is being implemented to ensure consistent presentation of this measure across all historical periods, once the required accounting guidance reclassification is reflected in our financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2018.  The adoption of this accounting change does not reflect a change in our underlying business or activities.2016 Separation Transaction. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the separation of its business into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation. Following the Separation Transaction, Arconic comprises the Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Ma’aden Rolling Company), the Engineered Products and Solutions, and the Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation comprises the Alumina and Primary Metals segments, the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Ma’aden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia.35Table of ContentsThe Separation Transaction was effected by the distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock to the Company’s shareholders (the “Distribution”). The Company’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company distributed 146,159,428 shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the Distribution and retained 36,311,767 shares, or approximately 19.9% (see disposition of retained shares under Results of Operations below), of the common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation is now an independent public company trading under the symbol “AA” on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Company trades under the symbol “ARNC” on the New York Stock Exchange.    On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.Results of OperationsEarnings SummarySales—Sales for 2017 were $12,960 compared with sales of $12,394 in 2016, an increase of $566, or 5%. The increase was the result of strong volume growth in all segments and higher aluminum pricing, partially offset by the planned ramp down and Toll Processing Agreement relating to the Company’s North America packaging business in Tennessee in the Global Rolled Products segment, as well as unfavorable product pricing in both the Engineered Products and Solutions and Global Rolled Products segments. Pursuant to the Toll Processing Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation on October 31, 2016 in connection with the Separation Transaction, Arconic provides can body stock to Alcoa Corporation using aluminum supplied by Alcoa Corporation, resulting in the absence of metal sales in 2017 compared to 2016.Sales for 2016 were $12,394 compared with sales of $12,413 in 2015, a decline of $19, or less than 1%. The relatively flat performance was the result of a full-year effect of two 2015 acquisitions in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment and automotive volume increases in the Global Rolled Products segment, which were more than offset by the ramp-down of the Tennessee packaging business and the impact of aluminum prices in the Global Rolled Products segment and unfavorable product price and mix across all segments.Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)—COGS as a percentage of Sales was 79.9% in 2017 compared with 79.2% in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to cost increases, including net higher aluminum prices of $84 and ramp-up costs related to new commercial aerospace engines, and a lower margin product mix, partially offset by net cost savings.COGS as a percentage of Sales was 79.2% in 2016 compared with 81.4% in 2015. The primary drivers in the improvement in COGS as a percentage of sales were productivity gains across all segments and higher volume in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment due to the benefit of a full-year effect of two 2015 acquisitions. This benefit was somewhat offset by overall cost increases across all segments and unfavorable product pricing and mix impacts primarily in the Engineered Products and Solutions and Global Rolled Products segments.Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses (SG&A) — SG&A expenses were $731, or 5.6% of Sales, in 2017 compared with $942, or 7.6% of Sales, in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was the result of expenses related to the Separation Transaction of $193 in 2016 compared to $18 in 2017, as well as ongoing overhead cost reduction efforts (see Restructuring and Other Charges below), partially offset by proxy, advisory and governance-related costs of $58, external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $14 and costs associated with the Company’s Delaware reincorporation of $3 in 2017.,SG&A expenses were $942, or 7.6% of Sales, in 2016 compared with $765, or 6.2% of Sales, in 2015. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to costs related to the Separation Transaction of $193 in 2016, an increase of $169 from 2015 separation costs.Research and Development Expenses (R&D)—R&D expenses were $111 in 2017 compared with $132 in 2016 and $169 in 2015. The decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by lower spending. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by the decrease in spending for the Micromill™ in San Antonio, TX which was completed in 2015 and began production of automotive sheet, on a limited basis, for the Global Rolled Products segment. 36Table of ContentsProvision for Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)—The provision for D&A was $551 in 2017 compared with $535 in 2016. The increase of $16, or 3%, was primarily due to capital projects placed into service. The provision for D&A was $535 in 2016 compared with $508 in 2015. The increase of $27 related to a full year of D&A related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information below).Impairment of Goodwill—In 2017, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $719, related to the annual impairment review of the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions business. In 2015, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $25 related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil.   See Goodwill under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below. Restructuring and Other Charges—Restructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 were comprised of the following:  201720162015Asset impairments$58$80$—Layoff costs647097Net loss on divestitures of businesses573136Other(3)27(11)Reversals of previously recorded layoff costs(11)(25)(8)Restructuring and other charges$165$155$214Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2017 Actions. In 2017, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $165 ($143 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $69 ($47 after-tax) for layoff costs related to cost reduction initiatives including the separation of approximately 880 employees (400 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 245 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 135 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and 100 in Corporate), a charge of $60 ($60 after-tax) related to the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill; a charge of $41 ($41 after-tax) for the impairment of assets associated with the agreement to sell the Latin America Extrusions business (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K); a net benefit of $6 ($4 after-tax), for the reversal of forfeited executive stock compensation of $13, partially offset by a charge of $7 for the related severance; a net charge of $12 ($7 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and a favorable benefit of $11 ($8 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2017, approximately 300 of the 880 employees were separated. The remaining separations for 2017 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In 2017, cash payments of $28 were made against layoff reserves related to 2017 restructuring programs.2016 Actions. In 2016, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $155 ($114 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $57 ($46 after-tax) for costs related to the exit of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K.; $37 ($24 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down a can sheet facility; $20 ($14 after-tax) for costs related to the closures of five facilities, primarily in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including the separation of approximately 280 employees; $53 ($33 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,315 employees (1,045 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 210 in Corporate, 30 in the Global Rolled Products segment and 30 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment); $11 ($8 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for the sale of Remmele Medical; $2 ($1 after-tax) for a pension settlement; and $25 ($12 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.In 2016, management made the decision to exit certain legacy Firth Rixson facilities in the U.K. Costs related to these actions included asset impairments and accelerated depreciation of $51; other exit costs of $4; and $2 for the separation of 60 employees.Also in 2016, management approved the shutdown and demolition of the can sheet facility in Tennessee upon completion of the Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation (see Global Rolled Products under Segment Information below). Costs related to this action included $21 in asset impairments; $9 in other exit costs; and $7 for the separation of 145 employees. The other exit costs of $9 represent $4 in asset retirement obligations and $3 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish the can sheet facility in Tennessee, and $2 in other exit costs.37Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 1,280 of the 1,700 (previously 1,750) employees were separated. The total number of employees associated with 2016 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within Arconic and natural attrition. The remaining separations for 2016 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In 2017 and 2016, cash payments of $26 and $16 were made against layoff reserves related to 2016 restructuring programs.2015 Actions. In 2015, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $214 ($192 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: a $136 ($134 after-tax) net loss related to the March 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in Russia and post-closing adjustments associated with the December 2014 divestitures of three rolling mills located in Spain and France; $97 ($70 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,505 employees (590 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 425 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, 400 in Corporate, and 90 in the Global Rolled Products segment); an $18 ($13 after-tax) gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in Australia that was permanently closed in December 2014; a net charge of $7 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $8 ($3 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2017, the separations associated with the 2015 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, cash payments of $5, $55 and $18, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2015 restructuring programs.Arconic does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pre-tax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows:  201720162015Engineered Products and Solutions$30$78$46Global Rolled Products7240121Transportation and Construction Solutions52148Segment total154132175Corporate112339Total restructuring and other charges$165$155$214Interest Expense—Interest expense was $496 in 2017 compared with $499 in 2016. The decrease of $3, or 1%, was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from lower outstanding debt, mostly offset by $73 primarily in higher premiums paid in 2017 related to the early redemption of $1,250 in debt. In the second quarter of 2017, Arconic redeemed all of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018 and 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the Company’s 5.72% Notes due 2019 in advance of the respective maturity dates.Interest expense was $499 in 2016 compared with $473 in 2015. The increase of $26, or 5%, was primarily due to debt issuance costs of $9 that were expensed in connection with the Separation Transaction and costs associated with the early redemption of $750 of 5.55% Notes due February 2017, completed on December 30, 2016, which included a $3 purchase premium, and a full-year of interest related to RTI International Metals, Inc. (RTI) debt of $6.Other Income, Net—Other income, net was $640 in 2017 compared with $94 in 2016. The increase of $546 was primarily due to the gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock of $351 (in February 2017, the Company sold 23,353,000 shares of Alcoa Corporation stock at $38.03 per share, which resulted in cash proceeds of $888 and a gain of $351) and the gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange (in April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the “Investment Banks”) in exchange for cash and the Company’s remaining 12,958,767 shares (valued at $35.91 per share) in Alcoa Corporation stock and recorded a gain of $167), income of $25 associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information), and income of $25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee.  The Company was required to provide a guarantee for an Alcoa Corporation electricity contract in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated the electricity contract at its Rockdale Operations and, as a result, Arconic reversed its associated guarantee liability.Other income, net was $94 in 2016 compared with $28 in 2015. The increase of $66 was mainly the result of a favorable adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment, both of which related to the acquisition of Firth Rixson of $76, and favorable foreign currency movements of $55. These items were partially offset by the absence of gains on the sales of land in the United States and an equity investment in a China rolling mill of $38 in 2015.38Table of ContentsIncome Taxes—Arconic’s effective tax rate was 115.7% in 2017 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate primarily differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of a $719 impairment of goodwill, a $41 impairment of assets in the Latin America extrusions business, and a $60 charge related to the sale of a rolling mill in Italy that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $272 tax charge as a provisional impact of the 2017 Act, and a $23 tax charge for an increase in an uncertain tax position in Germany, partially offset by a $73 tax benefit related to the sale and Debt-for-Equity Exchange of the Alcoa Corporation stock, a $69 tax benefit for the release of U.S. state valuation allowances net of the federal tax benefit, a $27 favorable tax impact associated with a non-taxable earn-out liability adjustment in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition, and by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions.Arconic’s effective tax rate was 356.5% in 2016 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction (see Income Taxes under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), a $95 tax charge associated with the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies whose tax basis was less than the redemption amount resulting in a taxable gain, a $51 net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate and tax law changes, and a $34 unfavorable tax impact related to certain separation costs which are nondeductible for income tax purposes, somewhat offset by a $39 discrete income tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances in Canada and Russia, a $38 tax benefit related to currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income, and a $26 favorable tax impact associated with non-taxable settlement proceeds and earn-out liability adjustments in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition.Arconic’s effective tax rate was 185.2% in 2015 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to a $190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Iceland (see Income Taxes under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), a $25 impairment of goodwill that is nondeductible for income tax purposes, a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in Russia for which no tax benefit was recognized, and a $34 net discrete income tax charge as described below.In 2015, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), the former joint venture owned 60% by Arconic and 40% by Alumina Limited, recognized an $85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Suriname (see Income Taxes under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. Arconic also had a $51 deferred tax liability related to its 60%-share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by AWAC.Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 27% and 29%. However, business portfolio actions, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stock-based payment awards, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate. It is also expected that continuing analysis of the 2017 Act, as well as additional guidance as it is issued, will have an impact on the estimated rate.Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests—Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was $74 for 2017, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $1,062 for 2016, or $2.58 per share. The increase in results of $988 was primarily attributable to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the Separation Transaction in 2016; a gain of $238 ($351 pre-tax) on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and a gain of $167 ($167 pre-tax) on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange in 2017; income of $25 ($25 pre-tax) associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition and income of $16 ($25 pre-tax) due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee; net cost savings; and higher sales volumes across all segments; partially offset by a charge for goodwill impairment of $719 ($719 pre-tax); a charge related to the 2017 Act of $272; $47 ($73 pre-tax) of higher premiums paid for the early redemption of debt in 2017; higher LIFO inventory expense associated with higher aluminum prices; charges for asset impairments of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill of $60 ($60 pre-tax) and Latin America extrusions business of $41 ($41 pre-tax) based on the sale of these businesses; unfavorable product pricing, primarily in aerospace; and lower-margin product mix.Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was $1,062 for 2016, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared to $157 for 2015, or $0.54 per share. The decrease in results of $905 was primarily due to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the Separation Transaction, primarily offset by a full-year effect of 2015 acquisitions (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information below) and net cost savings across all segments.Segment InformationArconic’s operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments: Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products and Transportation and Construction Solutions (see below).  In the first quarter of 2017, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance from After-tax operating income (ATOI) to Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, 39Table of Contentsdepreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”).  Segment performance under Arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance in 2017 was Adjusted EBITDA.  Arconic’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Prior period information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.  The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Certain items are excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA such as:  Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment - generally, when the price of metal increases, metal price lag is favorable, and when the price of metal decreases, metal price lag is unfavorable); corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities and corporate research and development expenses); and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company's primary measure of segment performance will change from Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this change, LIFO and metal price lag will be included in the Operating income of the segments.Adjusted EBITDA for all reportable segments totaled $2,144 in 2017, $2,063 in 2016, and $1,894 in 2015. The following information provides sales and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment, as well as certain shipment and realized price data for Global Rolled Products, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.Engineered Products and Solutions  201720162015Third-party sales$5,935$5,728$5,342Adjusted EBITDA$1,224$1,195$1,111The Engineered Products and Solutions segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks), and extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the oil and gas, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, British pound and the euro.In April 2016, Arconic completed the sale of the Remmele Medical business that was part of the RTI acquisition (see below) and manufactured precision-machined metal products for customers in the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets. Remmele Medical generated third-party sales of $23 from January 1, 2016 through the divestiture date, and, at the time of the divestiture, had approximately 330 employees.In July 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of RTI, a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical device end markets. The purpose of the acquisition was to expand Arconic’s range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials, primarily related to the aerospace end market. In 2014, RTI generated net sales of $794 and had approximately 2,600 employees. The operating results and assets and liabilities of RTI have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. In March 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of TITAL, a privately held aerospace castings company with approximately 650 employees (at the time of the acquisition) based in Germany. TITAL produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets. In 2014, TITAL generated sales of approximately $100. The purpose of the acquisition was to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish titanium-casting capabilities in Europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. The operating results and assets and liabilities of TITAL have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition.40Table of ContentsThird-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased $207, or 4%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily attributable to volume growth in both aerospace engines and airframes, partially offset by lower product pricing, primarily in the aerospace end market, and the absence of sales of $23 related to the Remmele Medical business, which was sold in April 2016.Third-party sales for this segment increased $386, or 7%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily attributable to higher third-party sales of the two acquired businesses of $457, primarily related to the aerospace end market, and increased demand from the industrial gas turbine end market, partially offset by lower volumes in the oil and gas end market and commercial transportation end market as well as pricing pressures in aerospace.Adjusted EBITDA for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased $29, or 2%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily on higher volumes and net cost savings, partially offset by product pricing pressures, ramp up costs associated with increasing production volumes of new aerospace engine parts, and a lower margin product mix.Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased $84, or 8%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily on net cost savings across all businesses as well as the volume increase from both the RTI acquisition and organic revenue growth, partially offset by a lower margin product mix and pricing pressures in the aerospace end market.In 2018, demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, driven by the ramp-up of new aerospace engine platforms. Demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing ramp-up of certain aerospace programs. Additionally, net cost savings are anticipated while declines in the industrial gas turbine market and pricing pressure across all markets is likely to continue.Global Rolled Products(1)  201720162015Third-party sales$4,992$4,864$5,253Intersegment sales148118125Total sales$5,140$4,982$5,378Adjusted EBITDA$599$577$512Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt)1,1971,3391,375Average realized price per metric ton of aluminum (2)$4,171$3,633$3,820(1) Excludes the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were previously part of the Global Rolled Products segment but became part of Alcoa Corporation effective November 1, 2016.(2) Generally, average realized price per metric ton of aluminum includes two elements: a) the price of metal (the underlying base metal component based on quoted prices from the LME, plus a regional premium which represents the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with physical delivery of metal to a particular region), and b) the conversion price, which represents the incremental price over the metal price component that is associated with converting primary aluminum into sheet and plate. In this circumstance, the metal price component is a pass-through to this segment’s customers with limited exception (e.g., fixed-priced contracts, certain regional premiums).The Global Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro, the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and the British pound.In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its Fusina, Italy rolling mill. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated third-party sales of approximately $54 and $165 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the time of the divestiture, the rolling mill had approximately 312 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above.On November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon the completion of the Separation Transaction. As 41Table of Contentspart of this arrangement, Arconic provides a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the expected end date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation supplies all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic processes the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenue for 2017 and the two months ended December 31, 2016 was $190 and $37, respectively.In March 2015, Arconic completed the sale of a rolling mill located in Belaya Kalitva, Russia. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $20 and $130 in 2015 and 2014 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 1,870 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above.Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment increased $128, or 3%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily attributable to volume growth in the automotive end market and higher aluminum pricing, partially offset by the impact of $362 associated with the ramp-down and Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation at the Company’s North America packaging business in Tennessee, the absence of sales of $111 from the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy, aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates, and pricing pressures in the global packaging market. Third-party sales for this segment decreased $389, or 7%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the ramp-down of Tennessee packaging of $251; lower aluminum prices; and lower demand in the industrial products, packaging, commercial aerospace, commercial transportation, and North American heavy duty truck markets. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume in the automotive market.Adjusted EBITDA for the Global Rolled Products segment increased $22, or 4%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily driven by net cost savings and increased automotive volumes, partially offset by lower aerospace volume from customer destocking and reduced build rates, continued pricing pressure on global packaging products and higher aluminum prices.  The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted the Global Rolled Products Adjusted EBITDA margin by $18, or 140 basis points, in 2017 compared with 2016.Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased $65, or 13%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by strong productivity improvements, which significantly exceeded cost increases, partially offset by lower pricing, primarily due to overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet market, unfavorable product mix and lower volumes as detailed above.In 2018, demand in the automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminum-intensive vehicles. Demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat in 2018 as the ramp-up of new programs is offset by lower build rates for aluminum intensive wide-body programs. The ramp-down of the North American packaging operations is expected to continue in 2018. Net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue.Transportation and Construction Solutions  201720162015Third-party sales$1,985$1,802$1,882Adjusted EBITDA$321$291$271The Transportation and Construction Solutions segment produces products that are used mostly in the commercial transportation and nonresidential building and construction end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold both directly to customers and through distributors. A small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are primarily the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Brazilian real.In December 2017, Arconic reached an agreement to sell its Latin America extrusions business that operates primarily in Brazil (see Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations above).  The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2018 following customary regulatory and anti-trust reviews.  The operating results and assets and liabilities of the extrusions business are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. Third-party sales for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increased $183, or 10%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily driven by increased volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets, higher aluminum pricing, and favorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by lower product pricing.42Table of ContentsThird-party sales for this segment decreased $80, or 4%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by lower demand from the North American commercial transportation end market, which was partially offset by rising demand from the building and construction end market.Adjusted EBITDA for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increased $30, or 10%, in 2017 compared with 2016, principally driven by net cost savings and higher volumes, partially offset by lower product pricing in the heavy-duty truck market, unfavorable product mix, and higher aluminum prices. The higher aluminum prices negatively impacted the Transportation and Construction Solutions Adjusted EBITDA margin by $19, or 120 basis points, in 2017 compared with 2016.Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased $20, or 7%, in 2016 compared with 2015, principally driven by net cost savings across all businesses and growth in the building and construction segment, partially offset by lower demand in the North American heavy duty truck and Brazilian markets.In 2018, we expect continued growth in the North American and European commercial transportation and building and construction markets and continued demand for innovative products. Additionally, net cost savings are anticipated.Reconciliation of Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to ArconicItems required to reconcile Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to Arconic include: the Provision for depreciation and amortization; Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment — generally, when the price of metal increases, metal price lag is favorable, and when the price of metal decreases, metal price lag is unfavorable); corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities and corporate research and development expenses); other items, including intersegment profit eliminations; Other income, net; Interest expense; Income tax expense; and the results of discontinued operations.The following table reconciles Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to Arconic:  201720162015Combined segment adjusted EBITDA$2,144$2,063$1,894Unallocated amounts:   Depreciation and amortization(551)(535)(508)Impairment of goodwill(719)—(25)Restructuring and other charges(165)(155)(214)Impact of LIFO(110)(18)101Metal price lag7227(175)Corporate expense(274)(454)(371)Other(71)(109)(74)Operating income$326$819$628Interest expense(496)(499)(473)Other income, net6409428Income from continuing operations before income taxes$470$414$183Provision for income taxes(544)(1,476)(339)Discontinued operations—121(165)Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest——(1)Net loss attributable to Arconic$(74)$(941)$(322)The significant changes in the reconciling items between Combined segment adjusted EBITDA and Net loss attributable to Arconic for 2017 compared with 2016 consisted of:•an impairment of goodwill related to the annual impairment review of the Arconic Forgings and Extrusions business in 2017;43Table of Contents•a change in the Impact of LIFO, mostly due to a greater increase in the price of aluminum, driven by higher base metal prices (LME) and regional premiums (increase in price at December 31, 2017 indexed to December 31, 2016 compared to the increase in price at December 31, 2016 indexed to December 31, 2015);•a favorable change in Metal price lag due to higher prices for aluminum;•a decrease in Corporate expense primarily attributable to costs incurred in 2016 related to the Separation Transaction, partially offset by proxy, advisory and governance-related costs and legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower incurred in 2017;•an increase in Other income, net, largely the result of the $351 gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and a $167 gain on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, income of $25 associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earn-out liability related to the Firth Rixson acquisition, and income of $25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separation-related guarantee;•a decrease in Interest expense due to lower outstanding debt, mostly offset by premiums paid for the early redemption of $1,250 of the Company’s long-term debt; and•a decrease in Provision for income taxes attributable to a charge for tax valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction of $1,267 in 2016, partially offset by a charge of $272 resulting from the 2017 Act that principally relates to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21%.The significant changes in the reconciling items between Combined segment adjusted EBITDA and Net loss attributable to Arconic for 2016 compared with 2015 consisted of:•an increase in Depreciation and amortization related to a full year of D&A related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above)• a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, due to fewer portfolio actions;•a change in the impact of LIFO, mostly due to higher aluminum prices, driven by higher base metal prices (LME) (increase in price at December 31, 2016 indexed to December 31, 2015 compared to a decrease in price at December 31, 2015 indexed to December 31, 2014);•a favorable change in Metal price lag, the result of higher prices for aluminum;•an increase in Corporate expense, largely attributable to an increase in costs related to the Separation Transaction of $193, partially offset by decreases in corporate research and development expenses and other various expenses;•an increase in Other income, net, as a result of income of $76 associated with the reversal of a contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment, both of which related to the November 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson;•an increase in Interest expense, due to debt issuance costs expensed associated with the Separation Transaction, a full year of interest related to the RTI debt and costs associated with the early redemption of $750 of 5.55% Notes due February 2017, completed on December 30, 2016, which included a purchase premium; and •an increase in Provision for income taxes attributable to a charge for tax valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction of $1,267.Reconciliation of Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDAItems required to reconcile Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA include: Depreciation and amortization; Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; Other income, net; Interest expense; Income tax expense; and Discontinued operations.44Table of ContentsThe following table reconciles Net loss attributable to Arconic to Consolidated adjusted EBITDA: 201720162015Net loss attributable to Arconic$(74)$(941)$(322)Depreciation and amortization551535508Impairment of goodwill719—25Restructuring and other charges165155214Other income, net(640)(94)(28)Interest expense496499473Income taxes5441,476339Discontinued operations—(121)165Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (1)$1,761$1,509$1,374(1) Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Consolidated adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Arconic’s operating performance. Additionally, presenting Consolidated adjusted EBITDA pursuant to our debt agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate Arconic’s ability to comply with its financial debt covenants. The Consolidated adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Environmental MattersSee the Environmental Matters section of Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesArconic maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. Management continued to focus on actions to improve Arconic’s cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. Cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Arconic’s operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.At December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of Arconic were $2,150, of which $402 was held by Arconic's non-U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries is generally used for operational activities of Arconic’s international businesses.  As such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions.   The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows has not been restated for discontinued operations, therefore the discussion below concerning Cash from Operations, Financing Activities, and Investing Activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 includes the results of both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation up through the completion of the Separation Transaction on November 1, 2016.Cash from OperationsCash provided from operations in 2017 was $701 compared with $870 in 2016. The decrease of $169, or 19%, was primarily due to lower operating results (net loss plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) of $345 and higher pension contributions of $20, partially offset by a favorable change in noncurrent assets of $111 due to the prepayment of $200 made in April 2016 related to a gas supply agreement for the Australia alumina refineries (Alcoa Corporation), a favorable change in noncurrent liabilities of $55, and lower cash used for working capital of $30. The components of the change in working capital included favorable changes of $114 in receivables; $87 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; and $278 in accrued expenses; mostly offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, including $163 in inventories; $170 in accounts payable, trade; and $116 in taxes, including income taxes.Cash provided from operations in 2016 was $870 compared with $1,582 in 2015. The decrease of $712, or 45%, was primarily due to lower operating results (net loss plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) of $985 and unfavorable changes in working capital of $104 and noncurrent liabilities of $21, partially offset by a favorable change associated with noncurrent assets of $218 and a decrease in pension contributions of $180.  The components of the unfavorable change in working capital included $450 in receivables and $122 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; partially offset by 45Table of Contentsfavorable changes in working capital including $322 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of the impact of purchasing metal from Alcoa Corporation and the timing of payments; $68 in taxes, including income taxes; $43 in accrued expenses; and $35 in inventories.Financing ActivitiesCash used for financing activities was $963 in 2017 compared with $754 in 2016 and $441 in 2015.The use of cash of $963 in 2017 was principally the result of $1,634 in repayments on borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and repayments on debt, primarily related to the early redemption of the Company’s 6.50% Bonds due 2018, 6.75% Notes due 2018, and a portion of the 5.72% Notes due 2019 (see Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information); and $162 in dividends to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $816 in additions to debt, primarily from borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities, and $50 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.The use of cash of $754 in 2016 was principally the result of $2,734 in payments on debt, mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilitates (see below) and the repayment in December 2016 of $750 of outstanding principal of 5.55% Notes due February 2017; $228 in dividends to shareholders; and $175 in net cash paid to noncontrolling interests. These items were mostly offset by $1,962 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowing under certain revolving credit facilities, and $421 in net cash transferred from Alcoa Corporation at the completion of the Separation Transaction.The use of cash in 2015 of $441 was principally the result of $2,030 in payments on debt, mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and the repayment of convertible notes assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of RTI (see below); $223 in dividends paid to shareholders; and $104 in net cash paid to noncontrolling interests. These items were mostly offset by $1,901 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below).In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above), Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder’s option under specific conditions. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes, holders will receive, at Arconic’s election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,294,000 shares using the December 31, 2017 conversion rate of 35.5119 shares per $1,000 (not in millions) bond or per-share conversion price of $28.1596), or a combination of cash and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) bond, together with accrued and unpaid interest.On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The proceeds are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Arconic. By an Extension Request and Amendment Letter dated as of June 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to July 25, 2020. In September 2016, Arconic entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Facility including the replacement of the existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. The amendment became effective on the separation date of November 1, 2016. The previous financial covenant, based upon Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was replaced. Arconic is required to maintain a ratio of Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.50 to 1.00 for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, declining to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter.The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconic’s ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Arconic’s ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconic’s ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2017, Arconic was in compliance with all such covenants.The Credit Agreement matures on July 25, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Arconic may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Agreement, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will pay a fee of 0.30% (based on Arconic’s long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2017) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility.46Table of ContentsThe Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.70% and 1.70% per annum, respectively, based on Arconic’s long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2017. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.The obligation of Arconic to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Arconic’s failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Arconic in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Arconic’s breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic.There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and no amounts were borrowed during 2017, 2016 or 2015 under the Credit Facility. In addition to the Credit Facility, Arconic has a number of other credit facilities that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $715 as of December 31, 2017, of which $640 is due to expire in 2018 and $75 is due to expire in 2019. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above).In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Arconic borrowed and repaid $810, $1,950, and $1,890, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 2.6%, 1.9%, and 1.6%, respectively, and 46 days, 49 days, and 69 days, respectively.In September 2014, Arconic completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic’s 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share, and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% Notes due 2024. The net proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this noncash equity transaction.Arconic’s cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Arconic’s debt by the major credit rating agencies.On May 1, 2017, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt at BBB-, an investment grade rating, with a stable outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3. On November 1, 2016, Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) downgraded Arconic’s long-term debt rating from Ba1, a non-investment grade, to Ba2 and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade Liquidity-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2. Additionally, Moody’s changed the outlook from negative to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on November 2, 2017). On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconic’s long-term debt rating at BB+, a non-investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the current outlook from evolving to stable (ratings and outlook were affirmed on July 3, 2017).Investing ActivitiesCash provided from investing activities was $540 in 2017 compared with cash used for investing activities of $165 in 2016 and $1,060 in 2015.The source of cash in 2017 included proceeds of $888 from the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock and the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project of $243, somewhat offset by cash used for capital expenditures of $596, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher and horizontal heat treat furnace) at the Davenport, IA plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility, and the injection of $10 into the Fusina rolling business prior to its sale.The use of cash in 2016 was mainly due to $1,125 in capital expenditures ($298 Alcoa Corporation), 29% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, IA plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility. This use of cash was primarily offset by $692 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, including $457 from the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies, $120 in proceeds related to the sale of the Intalco smelter wharf property (Alcoa Corporation), and $102 in proceeds ($99 net of transaction costs) from the sale of the Remmele Medical business, which was part of Arconic’s acquisition of RTI in July 2015; and $280 in sales of 47Table of Contentsinvestments, composed primarily of $145 for an equity interest in a natural gas pipeline in Australia (Alcoa Corporation) and $130 for securities held by Arconic’s captive insurance company.The use of cash in 2015 was mainly due to $1,180 in capital expenditures ($391 Alcoa Corporation) (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $141), 38% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion at the La Porte, IN plant, the automotive expansion at the Alcoa, TN plant, the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, IA plant, the aerospace expansion (isothermal press) at the Savannah, GA plant (Firth Rixson), and the specialty foil expansion at the Itapissuma plant in Brazil; $205 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of TITAL (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above); and $134 in additions to investments, including the purchase of $70 in securities held by Arconic’s captive insurance company and equity contributions of $29 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia (Alcoa Corporation). These items were somewhat offset by $302 in cash acquired from RTI (see Engineered Products and Solutions under Segment Information above); $112 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, composed of three land sales in Australia and the United States combined and post-closing adjustments related to an ownership stake in a smelter (Alcoa Corporation), four rolling mills, and an ownership stake in a bauxite mine/alumina refinery (Alcoa Corporation) divested from December 2014 through March 2015; and $40 in sales of investments, related to the sale of $21 in securities held by Arconic’s captive insurance company and $19 in proceeds from the sale of the remaining portion of an equity investment in a China rolling mill.Noncash Financing and Investing Activities. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. (See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.)In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed a Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks of a portion of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest.On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock, pursuant to the authorization provided at a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 76 million shares. As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares. In July 2015, Arconic purchased all outstanding shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870. As a result, Arconic issued 29 million shares (87 million shares—pre-Reverse Stock Split) of its common stock to consummate this transaction.48Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsContractual Obligations. Arconic is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Arconic also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2017, a summary of Arconic’s outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information):  Total20182019-20202021-2022ThereafterOperating activities:     Energy-related purchase obligations$71$40$26$5$—Raw material purchase obligations1,0138012102—Other purchase obligations512014125Operating leases44210815084100Interest related to total debt2,6753716934291,182Estimated minimum required pension funding1,600350675575—Other postretirement benefit payments78590180180335Layoff and other restructuring payments5858———Deferred revenue arrangements301218——Uncertain tax positions75———75Financing activities:     Total debt6,844291,8831,8703,062Dividends to shareholders—————Investing activities:     Capital projects42634086——Totals$14,070$2,219$3,935$3,157$4,759Obligations for Operating ActivitiesEnergy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from one year to six years. Raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum, titanium sponge, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to four years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. It is Arconic’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws.  Arconic has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2022 and 2027, respectively.Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs and special layoff benefit payments.Deferred revenue arrangements require Arconic to deliver product to a customer over the specified contract period through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract. While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made.Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2017. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “Thereafter” column as the Company is not 49Table of Contentsable to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.Obligations for Financing ActivitiesArconic has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Arconic paid $162 in dividends to shareholders during 2017. This amount includes dividends related to a class of preferred stock issued in September 2014, which converted to common stock on October 2, 2017 (see Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources above). Because all dividends are subject to approval by Arconic’s Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2017, there were 481,416,537 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 shares of outstanding Class A preferred stock. The annual preferred stock dividend is at a rate of $3.75 per share and the annual common stock dividend expected to be paid is $0.24 per share for 2018.Obligations for Investing ActivitiesCapital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2017. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $700 in 2018.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.At December 31, 2017, Arconic has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2018 and 2026 was $29 at December 31, 2017.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $8 and $35 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Arconic was required to provide payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, and amounts outstanding under these payment guarantees were $197 and $354 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  These guarantees expire at various times between 2018 and 2024, and relate to project financing for Alcoa Corporation’s aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default.  In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant Generation Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee.  For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,297.  Arconic was also required to provide guarantees of $50 related to two Alcoa Corporation energy supply contracts. These guarantees expired in March 2017. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide guarantees of $53 related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities. Notification of a change in guarantor to Alcoa Corporation was made to the appropriate environmental agencies and as such, Arconic no longer provides these guarantees.In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one-year claims purchase agreement with a bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium was paid by Alcoa Corporation.  The agreement matured in December 2017 and was not renewed in 2018 due to the decline in exposure to guarantee claims including a substantial reduction in the guarantees related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and also the elimination of the guarantee related to the Rockdale energy contract.  The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement will be made on an annual basis going forward.Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation, energy contracts and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2018, was $120 at December 31, 2017.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $62 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being 50Table of Contentsproportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts and, as a result, Arconic had $103 of outstanding letters of credit relating to these liabilities. The entire $103 of outstanding letters of credit were canceled in 2017 when Alcoa Corporation issued its own letters of credit to cover these obligations.Arconic also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2018, was $54 at December 31, 2017.As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $25 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters; the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity 51Table of Contentsoperates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic has eight reporting units, of which four are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, three are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, and the remaining reporting unit is the Global Rolled Products segment. More than 85% of Arconic’s total goodwill at December 31, 2017 is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Arconic Fastening Systems and Rings (AFSR) ($2,221) and Arconic Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,686) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporate’s goodwill.In January 2018, management announced a change in the organizational structure of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, from four business units to three business units, with a focus on aligning its internal structure to core markets and customers and reducing cost.  As a result of this change, goodwill will be reallocated to the three new reporting units and evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect any goodwill impairment as a result of this realignment.In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment.  For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed.  Arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the 2017 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for one reporting unit, Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products (within the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment). Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As such, no further analysis was required.Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.During the 2017 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for six reporting units as follows: AFSR, APP, Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (ATEP), and Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (AFE), which are all included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, Global Rolled Products, and Building and Construction Systems, which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The estimated fair value for five of the six reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. However, the 52Table of Contentsestimated fair value of AFE was lower than its carrying value.  As such, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719.  The decrease in the AFE fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that is impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year.Goodwill impairment tests in 2016 and 2015 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units, except for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil, the estimated fair value as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated carrying value of its reporting unit’s goodwill. As a result, management determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill was zero.  Arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of $25 in 2015. The impairment of goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the Brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies. As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the reporting unit.Properties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 11 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 3.75%, 4.20%, and 4.29%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $225 and either a charge or credit of approximately $3 to after-tax earnings in the following year.In conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology, the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the “spot rate” approach).  This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2017 and 2016 of $34 and $84, respectively, for pension plans and $6 and $14, respectively, for other postretirement benefit plans. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year.53Table of ContentsThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2017, 2016, and 2015, management used 7.75% as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2015, the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance. For 2018, management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. The decrease of 75 basis points in the expected long-term rate is due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average.A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $9 for 2018.In 2017, a net loss of $220 (after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and asset performance less than expected, which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2016, a net benefit of $1,601 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the transfer of $2,080 to Alcoa Corporation which was partially offset by a net charge of $479. The charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2015, a net charge of $10 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets, which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 29 basis point increase in the discount rate. In January 2018, the Company announced the freeze of its U.S. defined benefit pension plans for salaried and non-bargained hourly employees, effective April 1, 2018. Benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees (the “Pension Plans”) will cease. In connection with this change, effective April 1, 2018, impacted employees will commence receiving an employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation under the Arconic Salaried Retirement Savings Plan, and, for the period from April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, an additional transition employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation. As a result of this change to the Pension Plans, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to record a liability decrease of approximately $140 related to the reduction of future benefits and a curtailment charge of approximately $5 pre-tax.  For the full year 2018, the Company expects pension-related expense to be lower by approximately $50 pre-tax compared to 2017 full year expenses.  The lower pension expense expectation is based on preliminary year-end December 31, 2017 results and is inclusive of the change to the Pension Plans described above as well as expected changes in other pension-related assumptions.Additionally, in accordance with accounting guidance effective January 1, 2018 that requires the other components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented separately from the service cost component, approximately $110 of pension-related expense in 2018 is expected to be recorded in the Other income, net line item in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Stock-based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.As part of Arconic’s stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $54 ($36 after-tax), $76 ($51 after-tax), and $77 ($51 after-tax), respectively. Of these amounts, $15, $19, and $15 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees.54Table of ContentsMost plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable.Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.In 2017, Arconic released $98 of certain U.S. state valuation allowances.  After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, management determined that the underlying net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income estimates taking into account expected post-separation apportionment data. Valuation allowances of $750 remain against other net state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization. The need for valuation allowances against net state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.  Arconic also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $675 which offsets additional losses reported on the Spanish tax return filed in 2017 related to the Separation Transaction that are not more likely than not to be realized.  There is no net impact to the provision for income taxes, as the additional valuation allowance fully offsets the current year tax benefit in Spain.  Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2018 to 2027 (as of December 31, 2017).  Valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period.  After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends, incremental valuation allowances of $302 and $134 were recognized in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign tax credits of $57, $128, and $15 expired at the end of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance.  During 2017, an additional valuation allowance of $23 was recorded for current year excess foreign tax credits, offset by a net $14 reduction for other adjustments.  At December 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $379. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances, including the impact of the 2017 Act.Arconic will continue its analysis of the 2017 Act, including any additional guidance that may be issued.  Further analysis could result in changes to assumptions related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets including, but not limited to, foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, and state tax loss carryforwards.  Provisional estimates of the impact of the 2017 Act on the realizability of certain deferred tax assets have been made based on information and computations that were available, prepared, and analyzed as of February 2, 2018.  In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arconic will reassess the need for valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets as necessary during 2018.In 2016, Arconic recognized a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction, including $925 with respect to Alcoa Corporation’s net deferred tax assets in the United States, $302 with respect to Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States, $42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, and $(2) related to the net impact of other smaller items. After weighing all positive and negative evidence, as described above, 55Table of Contentsmanagement determined that the net deferred tax assets of Alcoa Corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income. As such, a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation.In addition, Arconic recognized a $42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the Separation Transaction. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.In 2016, Arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in Russia and Canada of $19 and $20, respectively. After weighing all available evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historical cumulative income and projected taxable income.Arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in Australia of $93 related to the Separation Transaction, in Spain of $163 related to a tax law change and in Luxembourg of $280 related to the Separation Transaction as well as a tax law change. These valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction, resulting in no net impact to tax expense. The need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and, as a result, the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.In 2015, Arconic recognized an additional $141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Iceland and Suriname. Of this amount, an $85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in Suriname, which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 (as of December 31, 2015). The remaining $56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in Iceland. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business, combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Related Party TransactionsArconic buys products from and provides services to Alcoa Corporation following the separation at negotiated prices between the parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Arconic for all periods presented.  Effective May 2017, upon disposition of the remaining common stock that Arconic held in Alcoa Corporation, they are no longer deemed a related party.Recently Adopted Accounting GuidanceSee the Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance section of Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Recently Issued Accounting GuidanceSee the Recently Issued Accounting Guidance section of Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.56Table of Contents",>Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Not material.,">Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Management’s Reports to Arconic ShareholdersManagement’s Report on Financial Statements and PracticesThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Based on the assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. /s/ Charles P.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.58Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.64Table of ContentsArconic and subsidiariesNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts)A. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and subsidiaries (“Arconic” or the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and require management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.The separation of Alcoa Inc. into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation, became effective on November 1, 2016 (the “Separation Transaction”). The financial results of Alcoa Corporation for all periods prior to the Separation Transaction have been retrospectively reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented prior to the Separation Transaction. The cash flows and comprehensive income related to Alcoa Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows and Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive (Loss) Income, respectively, for all periods presented. See Note C for additional information related to the Separation Transaction and discontinued operations.Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arconic and companies in which Arconic has a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which Arconic cannot exercise significant influence are accounted for on the cost method.Management also evaluates whether an Arconic entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether Arconic is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. Arconic does not have any variable interest entities requiring consolidation.Related Party Transactions. Arconic buys products from and provides services to Alcoa Corporation following the separation at negotiated prices between the parties.  These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Arconic for all periods presented.  Effective May 2017, upon disposition of the remaining common stock that Arconic held in Alcoa Corporation, they are no longer deemed a related party.Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.Inventory Valuation. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost for approximately half of U.S. inventories determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of other inventories is determined under a combination of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average-cost methods.Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded principally on the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of structures and machinery and equipment by reporting segment (numbers in years): SegmentStructuresMachinery and equipmentEngineered Products and Solutions2917Global Rolled Products3121Transportation and Construction Solutions2718Gains or losses from the sale of assets are generally recorded in Other income, net (see policy below for assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations). Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Interest related to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs.Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets 65Table of Contents(asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments. See Note F for information regarding asset impairments. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic has eight reporting units, of which four are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, three are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, and the remaining reporting unit is the Global Rolled Products segment. More than 85% of Arconic’s total goodwill at December 31, 2017 is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Arconic Fastening Systems and Rings (AFSR) ($2,221) and Arconic Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,686) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporate’s goodwill.In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.Arconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment.  For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed.  Arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.During the 2017 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for one reporting unit, Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products (within the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment). Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As such, no further analysis was required.Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow model (DCF) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts. Arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.During the 2017 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for six reporting units as follows: AFSR, APP, Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (ATEP), and Arconic Forgings and 66Table of ContentsExtrusions (AFE), which are all included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, Global Rolled Products, and Building and Construction Systems, which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The estimated fair value for five of the six reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. However, the estimated fair value of AFE was lower than its carrying value.  As such, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the AFE reporting unit of $719.  The decrease in the AFE fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that is impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return, while the carrying value increased compared to prior year.Goodwill impairment tests in 2016 and 2015 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company’s reporting units, except for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil, the estimated fair value as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated carrying value of its reporting unit’s goodwill. As a result, management determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill was zero. Arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of $25 in 2015. The impairment of goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the Brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies. As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the reporting unit.Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by reporting segment (numbers in years): SegmentSoftwareOther intangible assetsEngineered Products and Solutions634Global Rolled Products69Transportation and Construction Solutions516Revenue Recognition. Arconic recognizes revenues when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (truck, train, or vessel).In certain circumstances, Arconic receives advanced payments from its customers for product to be delivered in future periods. These advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the product is delivered and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred revenue is included in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) 67Table of Contentsfor the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.Stock-based Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable.Foreign Currency. The local currency is the functional currency for Arconic’s significant operations outside the United States, except for certain operations in Canada and Russia, where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. The determination of the functional currency for Arconic’s operations is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators.Acquisitions. Arconic’s business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Statement of Consolidated Operations from the date of the acquisition.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. For those businesses where management has committed to a plan to divest, each business is valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets of a business to be divested once they are classified as held for sale. Businesses to be divested are generally classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as either discontinued operations or held for sale.For businesses classified as discontinued operations, the balance sheet amounts and results of operations are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to 68Table of Contentsdiscontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, respectively, for all periods presented. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows is not required to be reclassified for discontinued operations for any period. Segment information does not include the assets or operating results of businesses classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These businesses are expected to be disposed of within one year.For businesses classified as held for sale that do not qualify for discontinued operations treatment, the balance sheet and cash flow amounts are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale for all periods presented. The results of operations continue to be reported in continuing operations. The gains or losses associated with these divested businesses are recorded in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The segment information includes the assets and operating results of businesses classified as held for sale for all periods presented.Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance. On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) to employee share-based payment accounting. Previously, an entity determined for each share-based payment award whether the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes resulted in either an excess tax benefit or a tax deficiency. Excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital; tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or in the income statement. Excess tax benefits were not recognized until the deduction reduced taxes payable. The changes require all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. In addition, the presentation of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in the statement of cash flows changed. Previously, excess tax benefits were separated from other income tax cash flows and classified as a financing activity. The changes require excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. Also, the changes require cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes to be classified as a financing activity. Further, for a share-based award to qualify for equity classification it previously could not be partially settled in cash in-excess of the employer’s minimum statutory withholding requirements. The changes permit equity classification of share-based awards for withholdings up to the maximum statutory tax rates in applicable jurisdictions. The prospective transition method was utilized for excess tax benefits in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB eliminating the requirement for an investor to adjust an equity method investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. In addition, an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting must recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB to derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments. These changes clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB to the accounting for Intra-Entity transactions, other than inventory. Previously, no immediate tax impact was recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of intra-entity transfers of assets. The previous standard precluded an entity from reflecting a tax benefit or expense from an intra-entity transfer between entities that file separate tax returns, whether or not such entities were in different tax jurisdictions, until the asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered. The previous standard also prohibited recognition by the buyer of a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference arising from the excess of the buyer’s tax basis over the cost to the seller. The changes require the current and deferred income tax consequences of the intra-entity transfer to be recorded when the transaction occurs. The exception to defer the tax consequences of inventory transactions is maintained. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB to the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test, which previously required measurement of any goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An entity will 69Table of Contentsperform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Arconic applied this new guidance on a prospective basis. See Goodwill policy above for further details.On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB which narrow the definition of a business and require an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, which would not constitute the acquisition of a business. The guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs. Arconic applied this new guidance on a prospective basis. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.On January 1, 2017, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB to the subsequent measurement of inventory. Previously, an entity was required to measure its inventory at the lower of cost or market, whereby market can be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The changes required that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby eliminating the use of the other two market methodologies. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. These changes did not apply to inventories measured using LIFO (last-in, first-out) or the retail inventory method. Arconic applies the net realizable value market option to measure non-LIFO inventories at the lower of cost or market. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. In May 2014, the FASB issued changes to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. These changes created a comprehensive framework for all entities in all industries to apply in the determination of when to recognize revenue and, therefore, supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition requirements and guidance. This framework is expected to result in less complex guidance in application while providing a consistent and comparable methodology for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s), and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new guidance by one year, making these changes effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018.Arconic will adopt the new guidance using the modified retrospective transition approach, reflecting the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard to revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018. The Company had formed a project assessment and adoption team that reviewed contract terms to assess the impact of adopting the new guidance on the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the Company generally recognizes revenue at a point in time upon delivery and transfer of title and risk of loss for most arrangements, based on the contract reviews performed, certain contracts within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment were identified as potentially moving to over time revenue recognition.  The Company modified certain contract terms in conjunction with its customers to remain at point-in-time revenue recognition. These modifications will not result in significant changes to revenue, business practices or controls. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company is in the process of identifying appropriate changes to its business processes and controls, as well as preparing for revisions to accounting policies and expanded disclosures related to revenue recognition in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued changes to equity investments. These changes require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values using the measurement alternative of cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Also, the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values has been simplified by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. Also, the new guidance will require changes in fair value of equity securities to be recognized immediately as a component of net income instead of being reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the gain (loss) is realized. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and have been applied on a prospective basis. Arconic elected the measurement alternative for its equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.70Table of ContentsIn February 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting and presentation of leases. These changes require lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability. Additionally, when measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, optional payments should be included only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, exercise a purchase option, or not exercise an option to terminate the lease. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019.  Arconic’s current operating lease portfolio is primarily comprised of land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.  A cross-functional implementation team is in process of determining the scope of arrangements that will be subject to this standard as well as assessing the impact to the Company’s systems, processes and internal controls.  Management is evaluating the impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements, which will require right of use assets and lease liabilities be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for operating leases. Therefore, an estimate of the impact is not currently determinable.  However, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.  In June 2016, the FASB added a new impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments, trade receivables, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and other loan commitments. The CECL model does not have a minimum threshold for recognition of impairment losses and entities will need to measure expected credit losses on assets that have a low risk of loss. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2016, the FASB issued changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The guidance identifies eight specific cash flow items and the sections where they must be presented within the statement of cash flows. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and will be applied retrospectively. As of result of the adoption, Arconic will reclassify cash received related to beneficial interest in previously transferred trade accounts receivables from operating activities to investing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.  This reclassification is expected to have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, but does not reflect a change in our underlying business or activities.  Additionally, Arconic will reclassify cash paid for debt prepayments including extinguishment costs from operating activities to financing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued changes to the classification of cash and cash equivalents within the statement of cash flow. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will be included within the cash and cash equivalents line on the cash flow statement and a reconciliation must be prepared to the statement of financial position. Transfers between restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents will no longer be presented as cash flow activities in the statement of cash flows and for material balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents an entity must disclose information regarding the nature of the restrictions. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and will be applied retrospectively. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.In March 2017, the FASB issued changes to shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2017, the FASB issued changes to the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The new guidance requires registrants to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item or items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Also, only the service cost component will be eligible for asset capitalization. Registrants will present the other components of net periodic benefit cost separately from the service cost component; and, the line item or items used in the income statement to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disclosed. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and will be adopted retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement, and prospectively for the asset capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost. The Company currently records non-service related net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general, administrative and other expenses and Research and development expenses and upon the adoption of this standard will be recorded separately from service cost in the Other income, net line item in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The impact of the retrospective 71Table of Contentsadoption of this guidance will be an increase to consolidated Operating income of approximately $154 and $135 while there will be no impact to consolidated Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The prospective adoption of the asset capitalization of only the service cost component will have an impact of approximately $20 in the first quarter of 2018 Statement of Consolidated Operations.In May 2017, the FASB issued clarification to guidance on the modification accounting criteria for share-based payment awards. The new guidance requires registrants to apply modification accounting unless three specific criteria are met. The three criteria are 1) the fair value of the award is the same before and after the modification, 2) the vesting conditions are the same before and after the modification and 3) the classification as a debt or equity award is the same before and after the modification. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018 and are to be applied prospectively to new awards granted after adoption. Management determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance that will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. It is intended to more closely align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management strategies, simplify the application of hedge accounting, and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019. For cash flow and net investment hedges existing at the date of adoption, Arconic will apply a cumulative-effect adjustment related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendment is adopted. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows a reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019.  Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on the Consolidated Financial Statements.72Table of ContentsB.

These amounts were reflected on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations in the line items indicated in footnotes 1 through 7.C. Separation Transaction and Discontinued OperationsOn November 1, 2016, Arconic completed the Separation Transaction. Alcoa Inc., which was re-named Arconic Inc., continues to own the Global Rolled Products (except for the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia), Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation includes the Alumina and Primary Metals segments and the aforementioned Warrick, IN rolling operations and equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were formally part of the Global Rolled Products segment.Arconic completed the Separation Transaction by distribution on November 1, 2016 of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to the Company’s shareholders of record (the “Distribution”) as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the “Record Date”). Arconic retained 19.9% of the Alcoa Corporation common stock (36,311,767 shares). In the Distribution, each Company shareholder received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of Arconic common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. Shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock. The Company had recorded the retained interest as a cost method investment in Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the December 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation was $1,020 at December 31, 2016 and was based on the closing stock price of Alcoa Corporation as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by the number of shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock owned by the Company at that date.In February 2017, Arconic sold 23,353,000 of its shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock at $38.03 per share, which resulted in cash proceeds of $888 which were recorded in Sales of investments within Investing Activities in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, and a gain of $351 which was recorded in Other income, net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.  In April and May 2017, the Company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks (the “Investment Banks”) in exchange for cash and the Company’s remaining 12,958,767 Alcoa Corporation shares (valued at $35.91 per share) (the “Debt-for-Equity Exchange”) (See Note I). A gain of $167 on the Debt-for-Equity Exchange was recorded in Other income, net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.  As of May 4, 2017, the Company no longer maintained a retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock.On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement (the “Toll Processing Agreement”), Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.Effective November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon completion of the Separation Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic provides a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the expected end date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation supplies all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic processes the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenues for 2017 and the two-month period ended December 31, 2016 and accounts receivable at 74Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were not material to the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to provide maximum potential future payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, guarantees related to two long-term Alcoa Corporation energy supply agreements, guarantees related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities and energy supply contracts, letters of credit and surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016, and letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts (see Note K).As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic had recorded a receivable in the December 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet for the net after-tax proceeds from Alcoa Corporation’s sale of the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project.  The transaction closed and the Company received proceeds of $238 in the first quarter of 2017 and the remaining $5 in the second quarter of 2017. The $243 proceeds were included in Other within Investing Activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.The results of operations of Alcoa Corporation were presented as discontinued operations in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as summarized below:  Ten monthsended October 31, Year ended         December 31,      2016 2015Sales$6,752 $10,121Cost of goods sold (exclusive of expenses below)5,655 7,965Selling, general administrative, and other expenses164 214Research and development28 69Provision for depreciation, depletion and amortization593 772Restructuring and other charges102 981Interest expense28 25Other (income) expenses, net(75) 30Income from discontinued operations before income taxes257 65Provision for income taxes73 106Income (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes184 (41)Less: Net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests63 124Net income (loss) from discontinued operations$121 $(165)During 2017, 2016 and 2015, Arconic recognized $18 ($12 after-tax), $193 ($158 after-tax) and $24 ($24 after-tax), respectively, in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for costs related to the Separation Transaction. In addition, Arconic also incurred capital expenditures and debt issuance costs of $110 during 2016 related to the Separation Transaction. None of the aforementioned costs and expenses related to the Separation Transaction were reclassified into discontinued operations.On November 1, 2016, management evaluated the net assets of Alcoa Corporation for potential impairment and determined that no impairment charge was required.The cash flows related to Alcoa Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for 2016 and all prior periods presented. The following table presents depreciation, depletion and amortization, restructuring and other charges, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of the discontinued operations related to Alcoa Corporation: For the year ended December 31,20162015Depreciation, depletion and amortization$593$772Restructuring and other charges$102$981Capital expenditures$298$39175Table of ContentsD. Restructuring and Other ChargesRestructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 were comprised of the following:  201720162015Asset impairments$58$80$—Layoff costs647097Net loss on divestitures of businesses (F)573136Other(3)27(11)Reversals of previously recorded layoff costs(11)(25)(8)Restructuring and other charges$165$155$214Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2017 Actions. In 2017, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $165 ($143 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $69 ($47 after-tax) for layoff costs related to cost reduction initiatives including the separation of approximately 880 employees (400 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 245 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 135 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and 100 in Corporate), a charge of $60 ($60 after-tax) related to the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill; a charge of $41 ($41 after-tax) for the impairment of assets associated with the agreement to sell the Latin America Extrusions business (see Note F); a net benefit of $6 ($4 after-tax), for the reversal of forfeited executive stock compensation of $13, partially offset by a charge of $7 for the related severance; a net charge of $12 ($7 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and a favorable benefit of $11 ($8 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2017, approximately 300 of the 880 employees were separated. The remaining separations for 2017 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In 2017, cash payments of $28 were made against layoff reserves related to 2017 restructuring programs.2016 Actions. In 2016, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $155 ($114 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $57 ($46 after-tax) for costs related to the exit of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K.; $37 ($24 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down a can sheet facility; $20 ($14 after-tax) for costs related to the closures of five facilities, primarily in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including the separation of approximately 280 employees; $53 ($33 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,315 employees (1,045 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 210 in Corporate, 30 in the Global Rolled Products segment and 30 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment); $11 ($8 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for the sale of Remmele Medical; $2 ($1 after-tax) for a pension settlement; and $25 ($12 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.In 2016, management made the decision to exit certain legacy Firth Rixson facilities in the U.K. Costs related to these actions included asset impairments and accelerated depreciation of $51; other exit costs of $4; and $2 for the separation of 60 employees.Also in 2016, management approved the shutdown and demolition of the can sheet facility in Tennessee upon completion of the Toll Processing Agreement with Alcoa Corporation. Costs related to this action included $21 in asset impairments; $9 in other exit costs; and $7 for the separation of 145 employees. The other exit costs of $9 represent $4 in asset retirement obligations and $3 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish the can sheet facility in Tennessee, and $2 in other exit costs.As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1,280 of the 1,700 (previously 1,750) employees were separated. The total number of employees associated with 2016 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within Arconic and natural attrition. The remaining separations for 2016 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In 2017 and 2016, cash payments of $26 and $16 were made against layoff reserves related to 2016 restructuring programs.76Table of Contents2015 Actions. In 2015, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $214 ($192 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: a $136 ($134 after-tax) net loss related to the March 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in Russia and post-closing adjustments associated with the December 2014 divestitures of three rolling mills located in Spain and France; $97 ($70 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,505 employees (590 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 425 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, 400 in Corporate and 90 in the Global Rolled Products segment); an $18 ($13 after-tax) gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in Australia that was permanently closed in December 2014; a net charge of $7 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $8 ($3 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.As of December 31, 2017, the separations associated with the 2015 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, cash payments of $5, $55 and $18, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2015 restructuring programs.Arconic does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments.

This goodwill is reflected in Corporate for segment reporting purposes because it is not included in management’s assessment of performance by the three reportable segments.In 2017, Arconic recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $719 related to the annual impairment review of the AFE reporting unit which is included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. In 2015, Arconic recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $25 related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business reporting unit which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment (see Goodwill policy in Note A).Other intangible assets were as follows: December 31, 2017GrosscarryingamountAccumulatedamortizationComputer software$789$(674)Patents and licenses110(107)Other intangibles953(116)Total amortizable intangible assets1,852(897)Indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks32—Total other intangible assets$1,884$(897)78Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2016GrosscarryingamountAccumulatedamortizationComputer software$755$(623)Patents and licenses110(102)Other intangibles897(81)Total amortizable intangible assets1,762(806)Indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks32—Total other intangible assets$1,794$(806)Computer software consists primarily of software costs associated with an enterprise business solution (EBS) within Arconic to drive common systems among all businesses.Amortization expense related to the intangible assets in the tables above for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $71, $65, and $67, respectively, and is expected to be in the range of approximately $60 to $75 annually from 2018 to 2022.F. Acquisitions and DivestituresPro forma results of the Company, assuming all acquisitions described below were made at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented, would not have been materially different from the results reported.2017 Divestitures. In March 2017, Arconic completed the sale of its Fusina, Italy rolling mill to Slim Aluminium. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. As part of the transaction, Arconic injected $10 of cash into the business and provided a third-party guarantee with a fair value of $5 related to Slim Aluminium’s environmental remediation. The Company recorded a loss on the sale of $60, which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges (see Note D) on the Statement of Consolidated Operations for 2017. The rolling mill generated third-party sales of approximately $54 and $165 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. At the time of the divestiture, the rolling mill had approximately 312 employees.In December 2017, Arconic entered into an agreement to sell its Latin America Extrusions business for $10 million in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The Latin America Extrusions business operates primarily in Brazil and is part of the Company’s Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. Following customary regulatory and anti-trust approvals, the ownership of this business is expected to be transferred to a subsidiary of Hydro Extruded Solutions AS in the first half of 2018.  As a result of the transaction, Arconic recognized a charge of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to the non-cash impairment of the net book value of the business (See Notes A and D).2016 Divestitures. In April 2016, Arconic completed the sale of the Remmele Medical business to LISI MEDICAL for $102 in cash ($99 net of transaction costs), which was included in Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This business, which was part of the RTI International Metals Inc. (RTI) acquisition (see below), manufactured precision-machined metal products for customers in the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets. Since this transaction occurred within a year of the completion of the RTI acquisition, no gain was recorded on this transaction as the excess of the proceeds over the carrying value of the net assets of this business was reflected as a purchase price adjustment (decrease to goodwill of $44) to the final allocation of the purchase price related to Arconic’s acquisition of RTI. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. This business generated sales of approximately $20 from January 1, 2016 through the divestiture date, April 29, 2016, and, at the time of the divestiture, had approximately 330 employees. 2015 Acquisitions. In March 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of an aerospace structural castings company, TITAL, for $204 (€188) in cash (an additional $1 (€1) was paid in September 2015 to settle working capital in accordance with the purchase agreement). TITAL, a privately held company with approximately 650 employees at the time of the acquisition and based in Germany, produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense markets. The purpose of this acquisition was to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish titanium-casting capabilities in Europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. The assets, including the associated goodwill, and liabilities of this business were included within Arconic’s Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, goodwill of $118 was recorded for this transaction. In the first quarter of 2016, the allocation of the purchase price was finalized, based, in part, on the completion of a 79Table of Contentsthird-party valuation of certain assets acquired, resulting in a $1 reduction of the initial goodwill amount. None of the $117 in goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes and no other intangible assets were identified. In July 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of RTI, a U.S. company that was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RTI.” Arconic purchased all outstanding shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870 (based on the $9.96 per share July 23, 2015 closing price of Arconic’s common stock). Each issued and outstanding share of RTI common stock prior to the completion of the transaction was converted into the right to receive 2.8315 shares of Arconic common stock. In total, Arconic issued 29,132,471 shares (87,397,414 shares pre-reverse stock split – see Note O) of its common stock to consummate this transaction, which was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash financing activity. The exchange ratio was the quotient of a $41 per RTI common share acquisition price and the $14.48 per share March 6, 2015 closing price of Arconic’s common stock. In addition to the transaction price, Arconic also paid $25 ($19 after-tax) in professional fees and costs related to this acquisition. This amount was recorded in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.RTI is a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical device end markets. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand Arconic’s range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials, primarily related to the aerospace end market. In 2014, RTI generated net sales of $794 and had approximately 2,600 employees. The operating results and assets and liabilities of RTI were included within Arconic’s Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Third-party sales and Adjusted EBITDA (Arconic’s primary segment performance measure – see Note N) of RTI from the acquisition date through December 31, 2015 were $309 and $21, respectively. During the third quarter of 2016, the final purchase price allocation was completed.Arconic recognized goodwill of $298, which represents the earnings growth potential of RTI, Arconic’s ability to expand its titanium capabilities in the aerospace market, and expected synergies from combining the operations of the two companies. This goodwill was allocated to a new Arconic reporting unit associated with the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, ATEP, which consists solely of the acquired RTI business. None of this goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.   Arconic also recorded intangible assets of $37 consisting mainly of customer relationships which are being amortized over a period of 20 years.As part of this acquisition, Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder’s option under specific conditions. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes, holders will receive, at Arconic’s election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,294,000 shares using the December 31, 2017 conversion rate of 35.5119 shares per $1,000 (not in millions) bond or per-share conversion price of $28.1596), or a combination of cash and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) bond, together with accrued and unpaid interest.  The cash conversion feature requires the convertible notes to be bifurcated into a liability component and an equity component. The fair value of the liability component was determined by calculating the net present value of the cash flows of the convertible notes using the interest rate of a similar instrument without a conversion feature. The fair value of the equity component is the difference between the fair value of the entire instrument on the date of acquisition and the fair value of the liability and is included as Additional capital on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.2015 Divestitures. In 2015, Arconic completed the divestiture of an operation in Russia (see below) and had post-closing adjustments, as provided for in the respective purchase agreements, related to a divestiture completed in December 2014. The divestiture and post-closing adjustments combined resulted in net cash paid of $11 and a net loss of $137, which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges (see Note D) on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. In March 2015, Arconic completed the sale of a rolling mill located in Belaya Kalitva, Russia to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stupino Titanium Company. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $130 in 2014 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 1,870 employees.2014 Acquisitions. In November 2014, Arconic acquired Firth Rixson. The purchase price included an earn-out agreement that required Arconic to make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through December 31, 2020 upon certain conditions. This earn-out was contingent on the Firth Rixson forging business in Savannah, Georgia achieving certain identified financial targets through December 31, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2016, management determined that payment of the maximum amount was not probable based on the forecasted financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $56 with a corresponding credit to Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, management determined that payment of the 80Table of Contentsremaining amount of the contingent liability was not probable based on the forecasted financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $81 to zero at December 31, 2017 with a corresponding credit to Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.

If valued on an average-cost basis, total inventories would have been $481 and $371 higher at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2017 and 2016, reductions in LIFO inventory quantities caused partial liquidations of the lower cost LIFO inventory base. These liquidations resulted in the recognition of immaterial income amounts in 2017, 2016, and 2015.H.

The Company recorded a charge of $58 ($27 in cash) primarily for the premium for the early redemption of the notes, a benefit of $8 for the proceeds of a related interest rate swap agreement, and a charge of $2 for legal fees associated with the transaction in Interest expense, and recorded a gain of $167 in Other income, net in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for the Debt-for-Equity Exchange.On June 19, 2017, the Company completed the early redemption of its remaining outstanding 6.50% Bonds, with aggregate principal amount of $100, and its remaining outstanding 6.75% Notes, with aggregate principal amount of $345, for $479 in cash including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of the early redemption of the 6.50% Bonds and 6.75% Notes, the Company recorded a charge of $24 in Interest expense in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for the premium paid for the early redemption of these notes in excess of their carrying value.In December 2016, Arconic elected to call for redemption the $750 in outstanding principal of its 5.55% Notes due February 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) under the provisions of the 2017 Notes. The total cash paid to the holders of the called 2017 Notes was $770, which includes $17 in accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the 82Table of Contentssettlement date, and a $3 purchase premium. The purchase premium was recorded in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. This transaction was completed on December 30, 2016.The Company has the option to redeem certain of its Notes and Bonds in whole or part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, plus in either case accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.Credit Facilities. On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (“the Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The proceeds are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Arconic.  By an Extension Request and Amendment Letter dated as of June 5, 2015, the maturity date of the Credit Facility was extended to July 25, 2020. In September 2016, Arconic entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement including the replacement of the existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. The amendment became effective on the separation date of November 1, 2016. The previous financial covenant, based upon Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was replaced. Arconic is required to maintain a ratio of Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 4.50 to 1.00 for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, declining to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter.The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconic’s ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Arconic’s ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconic’s ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2017, Arconic was in compliance with all such covenants.The Credit Facility matures on July 25, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Arconic may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will pay a fee up to 0.30% (based on Arconic’s long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2017) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility.The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.70% and 1.70% per annum, respectively, based on Arconic’s long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2017. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.The obligation of Arconic to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Arconic’s failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Arconic in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Arconic’s breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic.There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and no amounts were borrowed during 2017, 2016 or 2015 under the Credit Facility. In addition to the Credit Facility above, Arconic has a number of other credit facilities that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $715 as of December 31, 2017, of which $640 is due to expire in 2018 and $75 is due to expire in 2019. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above).In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Arconic borrowed and repaid $810, $1,950, and $1,890, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 2.6%, 1.9%, and 1.6%, respectively, and 46 days, 49 days, and 69 days, respectively.Short-Term Debt. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, short-term debt was $38 and $40, respectively. These amounts included $33 and $31 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to accounts payable settlement arrangements with certain vendors and third-party intermediaries. These arrangements provide that, at the vendor’s request, the third-party intermediary advances the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropriate discount, before the scheduled payment date and Arconic makes payment to the third-party intermediary on the date stipulated in accordance with the commercial terms negotiated with its vendors. Arconic records imputed interest related to these arrangements in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.83Table of ContentsCommercial Paper. Arconic had no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2017 and 2016. In 2017 and 2016, the average outstanding commercial paper was $67 and $127, respectively. Commercial paper matures at various times within one year and had an annual weighted average interest rate of 1.6%, 1.1%, and 0.6% during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.J.

Contingencies and CommitmentsContingenciesEnvironmental Matters. Arconic participates in environmental assessments and cleanups at more than 100 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) sites.A liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs. The liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, and technological changes, among others.Arconic’s remediation reserve balance was $294 at December 31, 2017 and $308 at December 31, 2016 (of which $41 and $48, respectively, was classified as a current liability), and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. In 2017, the remediation reserve increased by $5 due to a net charge associated with a number of sites and was recorded in Costs of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.  The change in the reserve also reflects an increase of $8 due to a reclassification of amounts included in other reserves within Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, and a decrease of $1 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were $26 in 2017 and include expenditures currently mandated, as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party.Included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs. These costs are estimated to be approximately 1% or less of cost of goods sold.The following discussion provides details regarding the current status of the most significant remediation reserve related to a current Arconic site.Massena West, NY—Arconic has an ongoing remediation project related to the Grasse River, which is adjacent to Arconic’s Massena plant site. Many years ago, it was determined that sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The project, which was selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a Record of Decision issued in April 2013, is aimed at capping PCB contaminated sediments with concentration in excess of one part per million in the main channel of the river and dredging PCB contaminated sediments in the near-shore areas where total PCBs exceed one part per million. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the reserve balance associated with this matter was $215 and $228, respectively. Arconic is in the planning and design phase of the project, which phase is now expected to be completed in 2018. Originally, the design was scheduled to be completed and approved by the EPA in 2017, but in the third quarter of 2017, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) sent a letter to EPA requesting revisions to the draft design. That caused EPA to delay their review and comment on the draft design.  EPA has now responded to the DEC letter and while issues remain, Arconic is now able to recommence work on the final design.  Following submittal of the final design and EPA approval, the actual remediation fieldwork is expected to commence and take approximately four years. The majority of the project funding is expected to be incurred between 2018 and 2022.84Table of ContentsTax. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (see Note C), dated as of October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, the Company shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation for, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the Company with respect to the following matter.As previously reported, in September 2010, following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years, an assessment was received as a result of Spain’s tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. An appeal of this assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court by the Company was denied in October 2013. In December 2013, the Company filed an appeal of the assessment in Spain’s National Court. On January 16, 2017, Spain’s National Court issued a decision in favor of the Company related to the assessment received in September 2010. The Spanish Tax Administration did not file an appeal within the applicable period. Based on this decision and recent confirming correspondence from the Spanish Tax Administration, the matter is now closed. The Company will not be responsible for any assessment related to the 2003 through 2005 tax years.Additionally, following a corporate income tax audit of the same Spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years, Spain’s tax authorities issued an assessment in July 2013 similarly disallowing certain interest deductions. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spain’s Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. The Company filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spain’s National Court in March 2015. Spain’s National Court has not yet rendered a decision related to the assessment received in July 2013. The assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years is $155 (€130), including interest.The Company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through Spain’s court system. However, in the event the Company is unsuccessful, a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement. Additionally, while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit, it is possible that the Company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter.Reynobond PE. As previously reported, on June 13, 2017, the Grenfell Tower in London, UK caught fire resulting in fatalities, injuries and damage. A French subsidiary of Arconic, Arconic Architectural Products SAS (AAP SAS), supplied a product, Reynobond PE, to its customer, a cladding system fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion of the cladding system to the façade installer, who then completed and installed the system under the direction of the general contractor. Neither Arconic nor AAP SAS was involved in the design or installation of the system used at the Grenfell Tower, nor did it have a role in any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design. Regulatory investigations into the overall Grenfell Tower matter are being conducted, including a criminal investigation by the London Metro Police, a Public Inquiry by the British government and a consumer protection inquiry by a French public authority. AAP SAS sought and received core participant status in the Public Inquiry. The Company will no longer sell the PE product for architectural use on buildings.In August and September 2017, two purported class action complaints were filed against Arconic and certain officers, directors and/or other parties, alleging that, in light of the Grenfell Tower fire, certain Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contained false and misleading disclosures and omissions in violation of the federal securities laws. Those cases remain pending.While the Company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. Given the preliminary nature of these matters and the uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome. The Board of Directors has also received letters, purportedly sent on behalf of shareholders, reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the Board authorize the Company to initiate litigation against members of management, the Board and others.  The Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee to review these shareholder demand letters and is considering the appropriate course of action. In addition, lawsuits are pending in state court in New York and federal court in Pennsylvania, initiated, respectively, by another purported shareholder and by the Company, concerning the shareholder’s claimed right, which the Company contests, to inspect the Company’s books and records related to the Grenfell Tower fire and Reynobond PE.Other. In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, and tax matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot 85Table of Contentscurrently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.CommitmentsPurchase Obligations. Arconic has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, energy and other goods and services, which total $861 in 2018, $176 in 2019, $74 in 2020, $13 in 2021, $6 in 2022, and $5 thereafter.Operating Leases. Certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment are under operating lease agreements. Total expense for all leases was $113 in 2017, $110 in 2016, and $112 in 2015. Under long-term operating leases, minimum annual rentals are $108 in 2018, $88 in 2019, $62 in 2020, $46 in 2021, $38 in 2022, and $100 thereafter.Guarantees. At December 31, 2017, Arconic has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers’ compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2018 and 2026 was $29 at December 31, 2017.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide certain guarantees for Alcoa Corporation, which had a combined fair value of $8 and $35 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were included in Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Arconic was required to provide payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, and amounts outstanding under these payment guarantees were $197 and $354 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These guarantees expire at various times between 2018 and 2024, and relate to project financing for Alcoa Corporation’s aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Arconic was required to provide guarantees related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default.  In October 2017, Alcoa Corporation announced that it had terminated one of the two agreements, the electricity contract with Luminant Generation Company LLC that was tied to its Rockdale Operations, effective as of October 1, 2017. As a result of the termination of the Rockdale electricity contract, Arconic recorded income of $25 in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with reversing the fair value of the electricity contract guarantee.  For the remaining long-term supply agreement, Arconic is required to provide a guarantee up to an estimated present value amount of approximately $1,297.Arconic was also required to provide guarantees of $50 related to two Alcoa Corporation energy supply contracts. These guarantees expired in March 2017. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide guarantees of $53 related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities. Notification of a change in guarantor to Alcoa Corporation was made to the appropriate environmental agencies and as such, Arconic no longer provides these guarantees.In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one-year claims purchase agreement with a bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium was paid by Alcoa Corporation.  The agreement matured in December 2017 and was not renewed in 2018 due to the decline in exposure to guarantee claims including a substantial reduction in the guarantees related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and also the elimination of the guarantee related to the Rockdale energy contract. The decision to enter into a claims purchase agreement will be made on an annual basis going forward.Letters of Credit. Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation, energy contracts and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2018, was $120 at December 31, 2017.Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $62 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being proportionally billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts and, as a result, Arconic had $103 of outstanding letters of credit relating to these liabilities. The entire $103 of outstanding letters of credit were canceled in 2017 when Alcoa Corporation issued its own letters of credit to cover these obligations.Surety Bonds. Arconic has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers’ compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2018, was $54 at December 31, 2017.86Table of ContentsPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $25 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers’ compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being proportionately billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.L.

These amounts were included in Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.Noncash Financing and Investing Activities. On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares (each depositary share representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the mandatory convertible preferred stock) were converted at a rate 87Table of Contentsof 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction (see Note O).In the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the Debt-for-Equity Exchange with the Investment Banks of the remaining portion of Arconic’s retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding notes held by the Investment Banks for $465 including accrued and unpaid interest (see Note I).On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split (see Note O). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively.In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 76 million shares (see Note O). As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares. In July 2015, Arconic purchased all outstanding shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870 (see Note F). As a result, Arconic issued 29 million shares (87 million shares—pre-Reverse Stock Split—see Note O) of its common stock to consummate this transaction.N. Segment and Geographic Area InformationArconic is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Arconic’s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Arconic’s segments are organized by product on a worldwide basis. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company changed its primary measure of segment performance from After-tax operating income (ATOI) to Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Segment performance under Arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance in 2017 was Adjusted EBITDA. Arconic’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization.  Prior period information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.  The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Items required to reconcile Combined segment adjusted EBITDA to Net loss attributable to Arconic include: the Provision for depreciation and amortization; Impairment of goodwill; Restructuring and other charges; the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment — generally, when the price of metal increases, metal price lag is favorable, and when the price of metal decreases, metal price lag is unfavorable); corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities and corporate research and development expenses); other items, including intersegment profit eliminations; Other income, net; Interest expense; Income tax expense; and the results of discontinued operations.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note A). Transactions among segments are established based on negotiation among the parties. Differences between segment totals and Arconic’s consolidated totals for line items not reconciled are in Corporate.Arconic’s operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments as follows:Engineered Products and Solutions. This segment produces products that are used mostly in the aerospace (commercial and defense), industrial, commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks); and extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the oil and gas, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets.88Table of ContentsGlobal Rolled Products. This segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. This segment includes sheet and plate sold directly to customers and through distributors in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers.Transportation and Construction Solutions. This segment produces products that are used mostly in the commercial transportation and nonresidential building and construction end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. A small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market.The operating results and assets of Arconic’s reportable segments were as follows:  Engineered Products and SolutionsGlobal Rolled ProductsTransportation and Construction SolutionsTotal2017    Sales:    Third-party sales$5,935$4,992$1,985$12,912Intersegment sales—148—148Total sales$5,935$5,140$1,985$13,060Profit and loss:    Depreciation and amortization26820550523Adjusted EBITDA1,2245993212,1442016    Sales:    Third-party sales$5,728$4,864$1,802$12,394Intersegment sales—118—118Total sales$5,728$4,982$1,802$12,512Profit and loss:    Depreciation and amortization$255$201$48$504Adjusted EBITDA1,1955772912,0632015    Sales:    Third-party sales$5,342$5,253$1,882$12,477Intersegment sales—125—125Total sales$5,342$5,378$1,882$12,602Profit and loss:    Depreciation and amortization$233$203$43$479Adjusted EBITDA1,1115122711,8942017    Assets:    Capital expenditures$308$178$57$543Goodwill3,949193604,202Total assets10,2524,1791,06815,4992016    Assets:    Capital expenditures$333$293$63$689Goodwill4,579181574,817Total assets10,5423,89198215,41589Table of ContentsThe following tables reconcile certain segment information to consolidated totals:  201720162015Sales:   Total segment sales$13,060$12,512$12,602Elimination of intersegment sales(148)(118)(125)Corporate48—(64)Consolidated sales$12,960$12,394$12,413  201720162015Combined segment adjusted EBITDA$2,144$2,063$1,894Unallocated amounts:   Depreciation and amortization(551)(535)(508)Impairment of goodwill(719)—(25)Restructuring and other charges(165)(155)(214)Impact of LIFO(110)(18)101Metal price lag7227(175)Corporate expense(274)(454)(371)Other(71)(109)(74)Operating income326819628Interest expense(496)(499)(473)Other income, net6409428Income from continuing operations before income taxes470414183Provision for income taxes(544)(1,476)(339)Discontinued operations—121(165)Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest——(1)Net loss attributable to Arconic$(74)$(941)$(322)December 31,20172016Assets:  Total segment assets$15,499$15,415Unallocated amounts:  Cash and cash equivalents2,1501,863Deferred income taxes7431,234Corporate goodwill333331Corporate fixed assets, net310308LIFO reserve(481)(371)Fair value of derivative contracts9124Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation—1,020Other73214Consolidated assets$18,718$20,03890Table of ContentsSales by major product grouping were as follows:  201720162015Sales:   Flat-rolled aluminum$4,992$4,864$5,253Fastening systems and rings2,1022,0602,168Investment castings1,9831,8701,812Other extruded and forged products1,5651,4951,332Architectural aluminum systems1,0651,010951Aluminum wheels805689790Other448406107 $12,960$12,394$12,413Geographic information for sales was as follows (based upon the country where the point of sale occurred):  201720162015Sales:   United States$8,167$7,823$8,044France965930802Hungary739619622United Kingdom721711698China615582565Russia500433455Germany309284264Brazil285250297Canada261262180Japan141145138Italy37127139Other220228209 $12,960$12,394$12,413Geographic information for long-lived assets was as follows (based upon the physical location of the assets): December 31,20172016Long-lived assets:  United States$4,005$3,966China347336Russia276295United Kingdom259232Hungary227194France159118Germany8864Canada6358Brazil6297Other108139 $5,594$5,49991Table of ContentsO. Preferred and Common StockPreferred Stock. Arconic has two classes of preferred stock: Class A Preferred Stock and Class B Serial Preferred Stock. Class A Preferred Stock has 660,000 shares authorized at a par value of $100 per share with an annual 3.75 cumulative dividend preference per share. There were 546,024 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Class B Serial Preferred Stock has 10,000,000 shares authorized at a par value of $1 per share. There were no shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2,500,000 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2016 (see below).In September 2014, Arconic completed a public offering under its shelf registration statement for $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each of which represents a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconic’s 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share (the “Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). The 25 million depositary shares are equivalent to 2.5 million shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Each depositary share entitled the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation, and voting rights, subject to terms of the deposit agreement. Arconic received $1,213 in net proceeds from the public offering reflecting an underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used, together with the net proceeds of issued debt, to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. The underwriting discount was recorded as a decrease to Additional capital. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock constitutes a series of Arconic’s Class B Serial Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to Arconic’s common stock and junior to Arconic’s Class A Preferred Stock and existing and future indebtedness. Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights.Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were cumulative in nature and paid at the rate of $26.8750 per annum per share in 2016 and 2015, which commenced January 1, 2015 (paid on December 30, 2014). On October 2, 2017, all outstanding 24,975,978 depositary shares were converted at a rate of 1.56996 into 39,211,286 common shares; 24,022 depositary shares were previously tendered for early conversion into 31,420 shares of Arconic common stock. No gain or loss was recognized associated with this equity transaction. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were paid at the rate of $20.1563 per share in 2017.Common Stock. Pursuant to the authorization provided at a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders held on October 5, 2016, shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of Arconic’s outstanding and authorized shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflected a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. The number of authorized shares of common stock was also decreased from 1.8 billion shares to 0.6 billion shares. The Company’s common stock began trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis on the NYSE on October 6, 2016.In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 25 million shares (76 million shares pre-Reverse Stock Split). As a result, Common stock and Additional capital in the accompanying 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding treasury stock.At December 31, 2017, 481,416,537 shares were issued and outstanding. Dividends paid in 2017 were $0.24 per annum or $0.06 per quarter and $0.36 per annum or $0.09 per quarter in 2016 and 2015. The current dividend yield as authorized by Arconic’s Board of Directors is $0.24 per annum or $0.06 per quarter.In July 2015, Arconic issued 29 million shares (87 million shares—pre-Reverse Stock Split) of common stock as consideration paid to acquire RTI (see Note F). Additionally, Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holder’s option under specific conditions. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes, holders will receive, at Arconic’s election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,294,000 shares using the December 31, 2017 conversion rate of 35.5119 shares per $1,000 (not in millions) bond or per-share conversion price of $28.1596), or a combination of cash and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive on such date $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) bond, together with accrued and unpaid interest.As of December 31, 2017, 47 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under Arconic’s stock-based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2017, 43 million shares remain available for issuance. Arconic issues new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options and the conversion of stock awards.92Table of ContentsShare Activity (number of shares)  Common stock  TreasuryOutstandingBalance at end of 201487,150,1691,216,663,661Issued for stock-based compensation plans(6,099,066)6,099,066Acquisition of RTI—87,397,414Balance at end of 201581,051,1031,310,160,141Issued for stock-based compensation plans(5,219,660)5,302,128Treasury stock retirement(75,831,443)—Reverse Stock Split—(876,942,489)Balance at end of 2016—438,519,780Conversion of convertible notes—39,242,706Issued for stock-based compensation plans—3,654,051Balance at end of 2017—481,416,537Stock-based CompensationArconic has a stock-based compensation plan under which stock options and restricted stock unit awards are granted in January each year to eligible employees. Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Stock options are granted at the closing market price of Arconic’s common stock on the date of grant and vest over a three-year service period (1/3 each year) with a ten-year contractual term. Restricted stock unit awards typically vest over a three-year service period from the date of grant. Certain of these awards also include performance and market conditions. For the majority of performance stock awards issued in 2017, 2016, and 2015, the final number of shares earned will be based on Arconic’s achievement of sales and profitability targets over the respective three-year performance periods. For awards issued in 2017, the award will be earned at the end of the three-year performance period.  For awards issued in 2016 and 2015, one-third of the award will be earned each year based on the performance against the pre-established targets for that year. The performance stock awards earned over the three-year period vest at the end of the third year. Additionally, the 2017 awards will be scaled by a total shareholder return (“TSR”) multiplier, which depends upon relative three-year performance against the TSRs of a group of peer companies. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Arconic recognized stock-based compensation expense of $54 ($36 after-tax), $76 ($51 after-tax), and $77 ($51 after-tax), respectively. The expense related to restricted stock unit awards in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 85%, 80% and 80%, respectively. No stock-based compensation expense was capitalized in any of those years. 2017 stock-based compensation expense was reduced by $13 for certain executive pre-vest cancellations which were recorded in Restructuring and other charges within the Statement of Consolidated Operations. At December 31, 2017, there was $43 (pre-tax) of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants and non-vested restricted stock unit award grants. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. As part of Arconic’s stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Of the total pre-tax compensation expense recognized in 2017, 2016 and 2015, $15, $19, and $15, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees.Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of the applicable equity grant. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value was equivalent to the closing market price of Arconic’s common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the 2017 performance awards containing a market condition was $21.99 and was valued using a Monte Carlo model.  A Monte Carlo simulation uses assumptions of stock price behavior to estimate the probability of satisfying market conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The risk-free interest rate (1.5%) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the remaining performance period.  Because of limited historical information due to the Separation Transaction, volatility (38.0%) was estimated using implied volatility and the representative price return approach, which uses price returns of comparable companies to develop a correlation assumption. For stock options, the fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model, which generated a result of $6.26, $4.78, and $10.07 per option in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The lattice-pricing model uses a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value of a stock option, including a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, exercise behavior, and contractual life. The following 93Table of Contentsparagraph describes in detail the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2017 (the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2016 and 2015 were not materially different, except as noted below).The risk-free interest rate (2.4%) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the time of the grant based on the contractual life of the option. The dividend yield (1.2%) was based on a one-year average. Volatility (38.1% for 2017, 44.5% for 2016, and 36.5% in 2015) was based on historical volatilities (except 2017 where we used comparable companies) and implied volatilities over the term of the option. Arconic utilized historical option forfeiture data to estimate annual pre- and post-vesting forfeitures (6%). Exercise behavior (59%) was based on a weighted average exercise ratio (exercise patterns for grants issued over the number of years in the contractual option term) of an option’s intrinsic value resulting from historical employee exercise behavior. Based upon the other assumptions used in the determination of the fair value, the life of an option (5.9 years) was an output of the lattice-pricing model. The activity for stock options and stock awards during 2017 was as follows (options and awards in millions):  Stock options Stock awards  Number ofoptionsWeightedaverageexercise price Number ofawardsWeightedaverage FMVper awardOutstanding, January 1, 201713$24.14 8$22.26Granted221.13 321.86Exercised(2)20.65 ——Converted—— (2)24.95Expired or forfeited(2)25.99 (2)21.26Performance share adjustment—— —21.48Outstanding, December 31, 20171123.94 721.49As of December 31, 2017, the number of stock options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.3 years and a total intrinsic value of $53. Additionally, 7.4 million of the stock options outstanding were fully vested and exercisable and had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.2 years, a weighted average exercise price of $25.90, and a total intrinsic value of $26 as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the cash received from stock option exercises was $50, $4, and $25 and the total tax benefit realized from these exercises was $4, $0, and $6, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $13, $1, and $19, respectively.94Table of ContentsP. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are computed by dividing earnings (loss), after the deduction of preferred stock dividends declared, by the average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding.The number of shares and per share amounts for all periods presented below have been updated to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (see Note O). The information used to compute basic and diluted EPS attributable to Arconic common shareholders was as follows (shares in millions):  201720162015Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Arconic$(74)$(1,062)$(156)Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests——(1)Less: preferred stock dividends declared(53)(69)(69)Loss from continuing operations available to Arconic common shareholders(127)(1,131)(226)Income (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests(1)—121(165)Net loss available to Arconic common shareholders—basic(127)(1,010)(391)Add: interest expense related to convertible notes———Add: dividends related to mandatory convertible preferred stock———Net loss available to Arconic common shareholders—diluted$(127)$(1,010)$(391)Average shares outstanding—basic451438420Effect of dilutive securities:   Stock options———Stock and performance awards———Mandatory convertible preferred stock———Convertible notes———Average shares outstanding—diluted451438420(1) Calculated from the Statement of Consolidated Operations as Income (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes less Net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests.In 2017, basic average shares outstanding and diluted average shares outstanding were the same because the effect of potential shares of common stock was anti-dilutive as Arconic generated a net loss. As a result, 39 million share equivalents related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, 14 million  (weighted average) share equivalents related to convertible notes (acquired from RTI - see Note O), 11 million stock options, and 7 million stock awards were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. Had Arconic generated sufficient net income in 2017, 30 million, 14 million, 5 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options, respectively, would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding. The mandatory convertible preferred stock converted on October 2, 2017 (see Note O).In 2016, basic average shares outstanding and diluted average shares outstanding were the same because the effect of potential shares of common stock was anti-dilutive as Arconic generated a net loss. As a result, 39 million share equivalents related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, 14 million share equivalents related to convertible notes, 13 million stock options, and 8 million stock awards were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. Had Arconic generated sufficient net income in 2016, 28 million, 10 million, 4 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options, respectively, would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding.In 2015, basic average shares outstanding and diluted average shares outstanding were the same because the effect of potential shares of common stock was anti-dilutive as Arconic generated a net loss. As a result, 26 million share equivalents related to mandatory convertible preferred stock, 7 million stock awards, 11 million stock options, and 5 million share equivalents related to convertible notes were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. Had Arconic generated sufficient net income in 2015, 26 million, 5 million, 4 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred 95Table of Contentsstock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options, respectively, would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding.Options to purchase 3 million, 10 million, and 9 million shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $33.32, $26.93, and $38.25 per share were outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive, as the exercise prices of the options were greater than the average market price of Arconic’s common stock.Q. Income TaxesThe components of income from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows:  201720162015United States$500$84$124Foreign(30)33059 $470$414$183The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:  201720162015Current:   Federal*$—$—$—Foreign98133115State and local(2)1(1) 96134114Deferred:   Federal*4891,208196Foreign3713629State and local(78)(2)— 4481,342225Total$544$1,476$339*    Includes U.S. taxes related to foreign incomeThe exercise of employee stock options generated a tax charge of $1 in 2017 and a benefit of $0 and $2 in 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing only the difference between compensation expense recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The tax effects related to the exercise of employee stock options in 2017 were recorded to the income statement within the provision for income taxes. Tax effects related to 2016 and 2015 were recorded to equity. Payments either decreased current taxes payable or increased deferred tax assets (net operating losses) in the respective periods. Arconic has unamortized tax-deductible goodwill of $24 resulting from intercompany stock sales and reorganizations. Arconic recognizes the tax benefits (at a 25% rate) associated with this tax-deductible goodwill as it is being amortized for local income tax purposes rather than in the period in which the transaction is consummated.96Table of ContentsA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to Arconic’s effective tax rate was as follows (the effective tax rate for all periods was a provision on income):  201720162015U.S. federal statutory rate35.0 %35.0 %35.0 %Taxes on foreign operations(7.5)(10.2)2.5Federal benefit of state tax3.10.40.3Permanent differences on restructuring and other charges and asset disposals(1)(167.4)(107.8)3.6Non-deductible acquisition costs0.38.47.1Statutory tax rate and law changes(2)52.5(15.7)(1.0)Tax holidays(3.0)(0.8)(3.9)Tax credits(0.7)(1.2)(2.8)Changes in valuation allowances137.9426.8145.8Impairment of goodwill53.5—4.8Company-owned life insurance/split-dollar net premiums—23.0(3.0)Changes in uncertain tax positions10.12.1(2.2)Other1.9(3.5)(1.0)Effective tax rate115.7 %356.5 %185.2 %(1) Additional losses were reported in Spain's 2017 tax return related to the Separation Transaction which are offset by an increased valuation allowance.(2) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""the 2017 Act”) resulting in significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code (see below).  In December 2016, Spain and the United States enacted tax law changes which resulted in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities recorded by Arconic. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017.   Also on December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118""), Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to address the application of U.S. GAAP for financial reporting.  SAB 118 permits the use of provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates in the financial statements.  SAB 118 also provides that the tax impact may be considered incomplete in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Act. Any adjustments to provisional or incomplete amounts should be included in income from continuing operations as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit in the reporting period that the amounts are determined within one year.As of February 2, 2018, the Company has calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the 2017 Act’s tax rate reduction and one-time transition tax in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the 2017 Act and guidance available and, as a result, has recorded a $272 tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. We anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018 in accordance with SAB 118.U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment of the 2017 Act are based on estimated temporary differences which will be updated and finalized with the filing of the 2017 U.S. income tax return.  Changes to the estimated temporary differences will result in changes to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.   As such, the impact of the 2017 Act’s tax rate reduction is a provisional amount under SAB 118 which will be updated during 2018.  The impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations, net of foreign tax credits, is also considered a provisional amount.  The Company will continue to analyze the amount of foreign earnings and profits, the associated foreign tax credits, and additional guidance that may be issued during 2018 and will update the estimated deemed repatriation calculation as necessary under SAB 118.  The Company has not yet gathered, prepared and analyzed all the necessary information in sufficient detail to determine whether any excess foreign tax credits that may result from the deemed repatriation will be realizable. The need for additional 97Table of Contentsvaluation allowance on foreign tax credits that may not be more likely than not to be realized in the future will be reassessed during 2018.The components of net deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  2017 2016December 31,DeferredtaxassetsDeferredtaxliabilities DeferredtaxassetsDeferredtaxliabilitiesDepreciation$31$693 $15$817Employee benefits93623 1,3828Loss provisions13414 1811Deferred income/expense191,144 2074Tax loss carryforwards3,305— 1,540—Tax credit carryforwards638— 652—Other2433 16419 5,0871,907 3,954919Valuation allowance(2,584)— (1,940)— $2,503$1,907 $2,014$919The following table details the expiration periods of the deferred tax assets presented above: December 31, 2017Expireswithin10 yearsExpireswithin11-20 yearsNoexpiration*Other*TotalTax loss carryforwards$81$781$2,443$—$3,305Tax credit carryforwards5319710—638Other——841,0601,144Valuation allowance(467)(646)(1,376)(95)(2,584) $145$232$1,161$965$2,503*Deferred tax assets with no expiration may still have annual limitations on utilization. Other represents deferred tax assets whose expiration is dependent upon the reversal of the underlying temporary difference. A substantial amount of Other relates to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes over an extended period of time as contributions are made to employee benefit plans and payments are made to retirees.The total deferred tax asset (net of valuation allowance) is supported by projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences (30%) and taxable temporary differences that reverse within the carryforward period (70%).Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic’s experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.98Table of ContentsIn 2017, Arconic released $98 of certain U.S. state valuation allowances.  After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, management determined that the underlying net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income estimates taking into account expected post-separation apportionment data. Valuation allowances of $750 remain against other net state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization. The need for valuation allowances against net state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.  Arconic also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $675 which offsets additional losses reported on the Spanish tax return filed in 2017 related to the Separation Transaction that are not more likely than not to be realized.  There is no net impact to the provision for income taxes, as the additional valuation allowance fully offsets the current year tax benefit in Spain.  Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2018 to 2027 (as of December 31, 2017).  Valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period.  After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends, incremental valuation allowances of $302 and $134 were recognized in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign tax credits of $57, $128, and $15 expired at the end of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance.  During 2017, an additional valuation allowance of $23 was recorded for current year excess foreign tax credits, offset by a net $14 reduction for other adjustments.  At December 31, 2017, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $379. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances, including the impact of the 2017 Act.Arconic will continue its analysis of the 2017 Act, including any additional guidance that may be issued.  Further analysis could result in changes to assumptions related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets including, but not limited to, foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, and state tax loss carryforwards.  Provisional estimates of the impact of the 2017 Act on the realizability of certain deferred tax assets have been made based on information and computations that were available, prepared, and analyzed as of February 2, 2018.  In accordance with SAB 118, Arconic will reassess the need for valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets as necessary during 2018.In 2016, Arconic recognized a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction, including $925 with respect to Alcoa Corporation’s net deferred tax assets in the United States, $302 with respect to Arconic’s foreign tax credits in the United States, $42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, and $(2) related to the net impact of other smaller items. After weighing all positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that the net deferred tax assets of Alcoa Corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income. As such, a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation.In addition, Arconic recognized a $42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the Separation Transaction. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.In 2016, Arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in Russia and Canada of $19 and $20, respectively. After weighing all available evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historic cumulative income and projected taxable income.Arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in Australia of $93 related to the Separation Transaction, in Spain of $163 related to a tax law change and in Luxembourg of $280 related to the Separation Transaction as well as a tax law change. These valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction, resulting in no net impact to tax expense. The need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and, as a result, the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.In 2015, Arconic recognized an additional $141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Iceland and Suriname. Of this amount, an $85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in Suriname, which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 (as of December 31, 2015). The remaining $56 charge relates to a valuation 99Table of Contentsallowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in Iceland. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business, combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period.The following table details the changes in the valuation allowance: December 31,201720162015Balance at beginning of year$1,940$1,291$1,151Increase to allowance831772180Release of allowance(246)(209)(42)Acquisitions and divestitures (F)(1)(1)29Tax apportionment, tax rate and tax law changes(24)106(15)Foreign currency translation84(19)(12)Balance at end of year$2,584$1,940$1,291As a result of the 2017 Act, the non-previously taxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (calculated based on U.S. tax principles) of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations has been subject to U.S. tax under the one-time transition tax provisions.  The cumulative amount of Arconic’s foreign undistributed U.S. GAAP earnings is estimated to be less than the total foreign earnings and profits already subject to U.S. tax as of December 31, 2017.  As such, Arconic expects to be able to repatriate these earnings back to the United States without additional income tax consequences other than foreign withholding taxes which will not have a material impact. At this time, management has no plans to distribute such earnings in the foreseeable future.  The Company will continue to evaluate whether to repatriate all or a portion of the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings in light of the 2017 Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under SAB 118.The 2017 Act creates a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder.  The 2017 Act also established the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT).  The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of these provisions and has not yet completed a reasonable estimate where we do not have the necessary information available, prepared, and/or analyzed (including computations) as it relates to the impact of the GILTI and BEAT provisions.  In addition, Arconic is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred or factor such amounts into the Company’s deferred tax calculation.  Arconic has not yet made this policy decision and will update the GILTI and BEAT impact in accordance with SAB 118.Arconic and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With a few minor exceptions, Arconic is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2006. All U.S. tax years prior to 2017 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining Arconic’s income tax returns for various tax years through 2016.100Table of ContentsA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was as follows: December 31,201720162015Balance at beginning of year$28$18$7Additions for tax positions of the current year2312—Additions for tax positions of prior years27—14Reductions for tax positions of prior years——(2)Settlements with tax authorities—(1)—Expiration of the statute of limitations(5)(1)(1)Foreign currency translation———Balance at end of year$73$28$18For all periods presented, a portion of the balance at end of year pertains to state tax liabilities, which are presented before any offset for federal tax benefits. The effect of unrecognized tax benefits, if recorded, that would impact the annual effective tax rate for 2017, 2016 and 2015 would be approximately 15%, 6%, and 7%, respectively, of pre-tax book income. Arconic does not anticipate that changes in its unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations during 2018 (see Tax in Note K for a matter for which no reserve has been recognized).It is Arconic’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the Provision for income taxes on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. In 2017, Arconic recognized interest of $1 but did not recognize any interest or penalties in 2016 or 2015. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, settlements with tax authorities, and refunded overpayments, Arconic recognized interest income of $2 and $1 in 2017 and 2015, respectively, but did not recognize any interest income in 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amount accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was $2 and $2, respectively.R. ReceivablesSale of Receivables ProgramsArconic has an arrangement with three financial institutions to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis. The sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Arconic. This arrangement provides for minimum funding of $200 up to a maximum of $400 for receivables sold. On March 30, 2012, Arconic initially sold $304 of customer receivables in exchange for $50 in cash and $254 of deferred purchase program under this arrangement. Arconic has received additional net cash funding of $300 for receivables sold ($2,358 in draws and $2,058 in repayments) since the program’s inception, including $0 ($600 in draws and $600 in repayments) in 2017 and $100 ($500 in draws and $400 in repayments) in 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the deferred purchase program receivable was $187 and $83, respectively, which was included in Other receivables on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase program receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase program receivable. The net change in the deferred purchase program receivable was reflected in the (Increase) decrease in receivables line item on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This activity is reflected as an operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant, short-term interest rate risk. See Note A for additional information on new accounting guidance that will affect the Company during 2018.In 2017 and 2016, the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase program receivable were $5,471 and $5,367, respectively, and $5,340 and $5,406, respectively. The gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collected under this program since its inception was $35,409 and $34,872 respectively. Arconic services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded.101Table of ContentsAllowance for Doubtful AccountsThe following table details the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to customer receivables and other receivables:  Customer receivables Other receivablesDecember 31,201720162015 201720162015Balance at beginning of year$13$8$6 $32$34$24Provision for doubtful accounts174 968Write off of uncollectible accounts(5)(3)(2) (1)(1)2Recoveries of prior write-offs—(1)— (3)1(1)Other(1)2— (3)(8)1Balance at end of year$8$13$8 $34$32$34S.

Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsArconic maintains pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in foreign locations. Pension benefits generally depend on length of service, job grade, and remuneration. Substantially all benefits are paid through pension trusts that are sufficiently funded to ensure that all plans can pay benefits to retirees as they become due. Most salaried and non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after March 1, 2006 participate in a defined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.Arconic also maintains health care and life insurance postretirement benefit plans covering eligible U.S. retired employees and certain retirees from foreign locations. Generally, the medical plans are unfunded and pay a percentage of medical expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life benefits are generally provided by insurance contracts. Arconic retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to change or eliminate these benefits. All salaried and certain non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2002 and certain bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for postretirement health care benefits. All salaried and certain hourly U.S. employees that retire on or after April 1, 2008 are not eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits.Effective January 1, 2015, Arconic no longer offers postretirement health care benefits to Medicare-eligible, primarily non-bargaining, U.S. retirees through Company-sponsored plans. Qualifying retirees (hired prior to January 1, 2002), both current and future, may access these benefits in the marketplace by purchasing coverage directly from insurance carriers. Effective August 1, 2016, in preparation for the Separation Transaction, certain U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were separated, requiring a remeasurement as of that date. Additionally, one pension plan was required to be remeasured as a result of settlement accounting. Together, these remeasurements resulted in an increase of $845 to Arconic’s pension liability and an increase of $551 (net of tax) to the plans’ unrecognized net actuarial loss (included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss).Effective April 1, 2018, benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees (the “Pension Plans”) will cease. In connection with this change, effective April 1, 2018, impacted employees will commence receiving an employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation under the applicable Arconic Retirement Savings Plans, and, for the period from April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, an additional transition employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation. 102Table of ContentsThe funded status of all of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of December 31 each calendar year.Obligations and Funded Status Pension benefits Otherpostretirement benefitsDecember 31,20172016 20172016Change in benefit obligation     Benefit obligation at beginning of year$7,026$14,247 $980$2,319Service cost90165 713Interest cost234435 3063Amendments12 ——Actuarial (gains) losses311770 1112Transfer to Alcoa Corporation—(7,577) —(1,340)Settlements—(82) ——Benefits paid, net of participants’ contributions(425)(794) (98)(197)Medicare Part D subsidy receipts—— 79Foreign currency translation impact122(140) —1Benefit obligation at end of year(1)$7,359$7,026 $927$980Change in plan assets(1)     Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$4,666$10,928 $—$—Actual return on plan assets21289 ——Employer contributions310296 ——Participants’ contributions—16 ——Benefits paid(404)(762) ——Administrative expenses(33)(65) ——Transfer to Alcoa Corporation—(5,610) ——Settlements—(82) ——Foreign currency translation impact111(144) ——Fair value of plan assets at end of year(1)$4,862$4,666 $—$—Funded status*$(2,497)$(2,360) $(927)$(980)Less: Amounts attributed to joint venture partners—— ——Net funded status$(2,497)$(2,360) $(927)$(980)Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of:     Noncurrent assets$89$6 $—$—Current liabilities(22)(21) (86)(91)Noncurrent liabilities(2,564)(2,345) (841)(889)Net amount recognized$(2,497)$(2,360) $(927)$(980)Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:     Net actuarial loss$3,240$2,979 $146$150Prior service cost (benefit)1015 (37)(45)Total, before tax effect3,2502,994 109105Less: Amounts attributed to joint venture partners—— ——Net amount recognized, before tax effect$3,250$2,994 $109$105Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss consist of:     Net actuarial loss (gain)$481$(1,992) $1$(224)Amortization of accumulated net actuarial loss(220)(380) (5)(24)Prior service (benefit) cost—(42) —37Amortization of prior service (cost) benefit(5)(13) 824Total, before tax effect256(2,427) 4(187)Less: Amounts attributed to joint venture partners—38 ——Net amount recognized, before tax effect$256$(2,389) $4$(187)103Table of Contents(1) At December 31, 2017, the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status for U.S. pension plans were $6,018, $3,544, and $(2,474), respectively.

The cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, industrials, transportation, and utilities, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 11 years. The underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company’s plans’ obligations multiple times.The rate of compensation increase is based upon actual experience. For 2018, the rate of compensation increase will be 3.5%, which approximates the five-year average.Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (assumptions for non-U.S. plans did not differ materially):  201720162015Discount rate to calculate service cost*4.20%4.29%4.00%Discount rate to calculate interest cost*3.603.154.00Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets7.757.757.75Rate of compensation increase3.503.503.50*In all periods presented, the respective discount rates were used to determine net periodic benefit cost for most U.S. pension plans for the full annual period. However, the discount rates for a limited number of plans were updated during 2017, 2016, and 2015 to reflect the remeasurement of these plans due to new union labor agreements, settlements, and/or curtailments. The updated discount rates used were not significantly different from the discount rates presented.In conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of Arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs is determined in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the interest component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology, the interest cost component is determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the “spot rate” approach). This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2017 and 2016 of $34 and $84, respectively, for pension plans and $6 and $14, respectively, for other postretirement benefit plans. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this 105Table of Contentsassumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management’s own judgment.For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the expected long-term rate of return used by management was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. In 2015, the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance. For 2018, management anticipates that 7.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return.  The decrease of 75 basis points in the expected long-term rate is due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20-year moving average.Assumed health care cost trend rates for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans were as follows (assumptions for non-U.S. plans did not differ materially):  201720162015Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year5.50%5.50%5.50%Rate to which the cost trend rate gradually declines4.50%4.50%4.50%Year that the rate reaches the rate at which it is assumed to remain202120202019The assumed health care cost trend rate is used to measure the expected cost of gross eligible charges covered by Arconic’s other postretirement benefit plans. For 2018, a 5.5% trend rate will be used, reflecting management’s best estimate of the change in future health care costs covered by the plans. The plans’ actual annual health care cost trend experience over the past three years has ranged from (2.2%) to 9.0%. Management does not believe this three-year range is indicative of expected increases for future health care costs over the long-term.Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in these assumed rates would have the following effects:  1%increase1%decreaseEffect on other postretirement benefit obligations$29$(28)Effect on total of service and interest cost components1(1)Plan AssetsArconic’s pension plans’ investment policy and weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2017 and 2016, by asset class, were as follows:   Plan assetsatDecember 31,Asset classPolicy range20172016Equities20–55%28%30%Fixed income25–55%4742Other investments15–35%2528Total 100%100%The principal objectives underlying the investment of the pension plans’ assets are to ensure that Arconic can properly fund benefit obligations as they become due under a broad range of potential economic and financial scenarios, maximize the long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on such obligations, and broadly diversify investments across and within various asset classes to protect asset values against adverse movements. Specific objectives for long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities and achieving diversification across the balance of the asset portfolio. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving 106Table of Contentsoverall investment policy objectives. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities. Exposure to broad equity risk has been decreased and diversified through investments in discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds, long/short equity hedge funds, high yield bonds, emerging market debt and global and emerging market equities. Investments are further diversified by strategy, asset class, geography, and sector to enhance returns and mitigate downside risk. A large number of external investment managers are used to gain broad exposure to the financial markets and to mitigate manager-concentration risk.Investment practices comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and other applicable laws and regulations.The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the trustees to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified (see Note U for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy).Equities. These securities consist of: (i) direct investments in the stock of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. companies and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (ii) the plans’ share of commingled funds that are invested in the stock of publicly traded companies and are valued at the net asset value of shares held at December 31 (included in Level 1); and (iii) direct investments in long/short equity hedge funds and private equity (limited partnerships and venture capital partnerships) and are valued by investment managers based on the most recent financial information available, which typically represents significant unobservable data.Fixed income. These securities consist of: (i) U.S. government debt and are generally valued using quoted prices (included in Level 1); (ii) publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally corporate and sovereign bonds and debentures) and are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data (included in Level 2); (iii) cash and cash equivalents; and (iv) interest rate swaps and are generally valued using industry standard models with market-based observable inputs.Other investments. These investments include, among others: (i) exchange traded funds, such as gold, and real estate investment trusts and are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the investments are traded (included in Level 1) and (ii) direct investments of discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds and private real estate (includes limited partnerships) and are valued by investment managers based on the most recent financial information available, which typically represents significant unobservable data.The fair value methods described above may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Additionally, while Arconic believes the valuation methods used by the plans’ trustees are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.107Table of ContentsThe following table presents the fair value of pension plan assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy or net asset cost: December 31, 2017Level 1Level 2Net asset valueTotalEquities:  Equity securities$379$—$593$972Long/short equity hedge funds——230230Private equity——155155 $379$—$978$1,357Fixed income:  Intermediate and long duration government/credit$201$981$779$1,961Other1648145317 $365$989$924$2,278Other investments:  Real estate$85$—$172$257Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds——583583Other777275359 $162$7$1,030$1,199Net plan assets*$906$996$2,932$4,834December 31, 2016Level 1Level 2Net Asset ValueTotalEquities  Equity securities$393$—$431$824Long/short equity hedge funds——406406Private equity——165165 $393$—$1,002$1,395Fixed income:   Intermediate and long duration government/credit$23$95$655$773Other1,06051741,185 $1,083$146$729$1,958Other investments:  Real estate$81$—$185$266Discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds——784784Other65—178243 $146$—$1,147$1,293Net plan assets**$1,622$146$2,878$4,646*As of December 31, 2017, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net receivable of $28, which represents assets due from Alcoa Corporation as a result of plan separations and securities sold but not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.**As of December 31, 2016, the total fair value of pension plans’ assets excludes a net receivable of $20, which represents assets due from Alcoa Corporation as a result of plan separations and securities sold not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments.Funding and Cash FlowsIt is Arconic’s policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country benefits laws and tax laws. Periodically, Arconic contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. In 2017 and 2016, cash contributions to Arconic’s pension plans were $310 and $290. The minimum required contribution to pension plans in 2018 is estimated to be $350, of which $320 is for U.S. plans.During the third quarter of 2016, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation approved management’s plan to separate the former Alcoa Inc. pension plans between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction. The plan stipulates that Arconic will make cash contributions totaling $150 over a period of 30 months to its two largest pension plans. The payments are expected to be made in increments no less than $50 each over the 30-month period, with the first 108Table of Contentspayment due no later than six months after the separation date of November 1, 2016. The first payment of $50 was made on April 18, 2017.Benefit payments expected to be paid to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ participants and expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts are as follows utilizing the current assumptions outlined above: Year ended December 31,Pensionbenefits paidGross Other post-retirementbenefitsMedicare Part Dsubsidy receiptsNet Other post-retirementbenefits2018$435$90$5$85201944090585202044090585202144590585202245090585Thereafter2,26533525310 $4,475$785$50$735Defined Contribution PlansArconic sponsors savings and investment plans in various countries, primarily in the United States. Expenses related to these plans were $89 in 2017, $71 in 2016, and $83 in 2015. In the United States, employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, and Arconic matches a portion of these contributions in equivalent form of the investments elected by the employee.U. Other Financial InstrumentsFair Value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (ii) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:•Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.•Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3—Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.109Table of ContentsThe carrying values and fair values of Arconic’s financial instruments were as follows:  2017 2016December 31,CarryingvalueFairvalue CarryingvalueFairvalueCash and cash equivalents$2,150$2,150 $1,863$1,863Restricted cash44 1515Derivatives – current asset6161 1414Noncurrent receivables2020 2121Derivatives – noncurrent asset3333 1010Available-for-sale securities106106 102102Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation—— 1,0201,020Short-term debt3838 4040Derivatives – current liability4545 55Commercial paper—— ——Derivatives – noncurrent liability1414 33Contingent payment related to an acquisition—— 7878Long-term debt, less amount due within one year6,8067,443 8,0448,519The following methods were used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments:Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Short-term debt, and Commercial paper. The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments. The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, and Commercial paper were classified in Level 1, and Short-term debt was classified in Level 2.Derivatives. The fair value of derivative contracts classified as Level 1 was based on identical unrestricted assets and liabilities. The fair value of derivative contracts classified as Level 2 was based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates).Noncurrent receivables. The fair value of noncurrent receivables was based on anticipated cash flows, which approximates carrying value, and was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Available-for-sale securities. The fair value of such securities was based on quoted market prices. These financial instruments consist of exchange-traded fixed income securities, which are carried at fair value and were classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation (see Note C). The fair value was based on the closing stock price of Alcoa Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2016 multiplied by the number of shares of Alcoa Corporation stock owned by Arconic as of December 31, 2016. This investment was classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.Contingent payment related to an acquisition (see Note F). The fair value was based on the net present value of expected future cash flows and was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.Long-term debt, less amount due within one year. The fair value was based on quoted market prices for public debt and on interest rates that are currently available to Arconic for issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities for non-public debt. The fair value amounts for all Long-term debt were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.110Table of ContentsV. Subsequent EventsManagement evaluated all activity of Arconic and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, except as noted below:In January 2018, the Company announced the freeze of its U.S. defined benefit pension plans for salaried and non-bargained hourly employees, effective April 1, 2018. Benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the Company’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly employees (the “Pension Plans”) will cease. In connection with this change, effective April 1, 2018, impacted employees will commence receiving an employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation under the Arconic Salaried Retirement Savings Plan, and, for the period from April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, an additional transition employer contribution of 3% of eligible compensation.In January 2018, management announced a change in the organizational structure of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, from four business units to three business units, with a focus on aligning its internal structure to core markets and customers and reducing cost.  As a result of this change, goodwill will be reallocated to the three new reporting units and evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect any goodwill impairment as a result of the realignment.In February 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 of its outstanding common stock and a $500 early debt reduction.  Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate.  Repurchases will be subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. Arconic is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. For the early debt reduction, Arconic intends to redeem in March 2018 all of its outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company's primary measure of segment performance will change from Adjusted EBITDA to Operating income, which more closely aligns segment performance with Operating income as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As part of this change, LIFO and metal price lag will be included in the Operating income of the segments.111Table of ContentsSupplemental Financial Information (unaudited)Quarterly Data(in millions, except per-share amounts)  FirstSecondThirdFourth(2)Year2017     Sales$3,192$3,261$3,236$3,271$12,960Net income (loss) attributable to Arconic$322$212$119$(727)$(74)Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Arconic common shareholders(1):     Basic     Net income (loss) per share—basic$0.69$0.44$0.23$(1.51)$(0.28)Diluted     Net income (loss) per share—diluted$0.65$0.43$0.22$(1.51)$(0.28)2016     Sales$3,055$3,234$3,138$2,967$12,394Net income (loss) attributable to Arconic$16$135$166$(1,258)$(941)Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Arconic common shareholders(1):     Basic     Continuing operations$0.21$0.08$0.11$(2.98)$(2.58)Discontinued operations(0.21)0.190.230.070.27Net income (loss) per share—basic$0.00$0.27$0.34$(2.91)$(2.31)Diluted     Continuing operations$0.21$0.08$0.11$(2.98)$(2.58)Discontinued operations(0.21)0.190.220.070.27Net income (loss) per share—basic$0.00$0.27$0.33$(2.91)$(2.31)(1) Per share amounts are calculated independently for each period presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal the per share amounts for the year.(2) In the fourth quarter of 2017, Arconic recorded an impairment of goodwill related to the forgings and extrusions business of $719 ($719 pre-tax); a provisional charge of $272 associated with the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as a one-time transition tax on the non-previously taxed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations as of December 31, 2017; a favorable adjustment to the Firth Rixson earn-out liability of $81 ($81 pre-tax); and a favorable adjustment to a separation-related guarantee liability of $18 ($25 pre-tax).

Risk Factors.  Arconics business,
financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business, financial condition or
results of operations, including causing Arconics actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not
all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Arconic or that Arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the
Company in future periods.  The markets for Arconics products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors,
including global economic conditions.  Arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace, automotive, and commercial construction and transportation industries, and the demand for its products is
sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other
factors beyond its control.  In particular, Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry,
which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. The U.S. and international commercial aviation
industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies,
the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators, the retirement of older aircraft,
and technological improvements to new engines. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign
policy, the retirement of older aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines.  Further, the demand for Arconics automotive
and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive manufacturers and Arconic content per vehicle. The automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions, including credit markets and
interest rates, and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage, vehicle size, configuration and features. Automotive sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and
related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and levels of competition.

While Arconic believes that the long-term prospects for its products are positive, the Company is unable to
predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government intervention. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or
disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Arconics business, financial condition or results of operations.  Arconics business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum. 
Arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminum-based products. The price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to
significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable. Although the Companys pricing of products is generally intended to pass the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the
Companys customers, Arconic may not be able to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there can be a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the Company can implement
a corresponding increase in price to its customers. As a result, Arconic may be exposed to such price fluctuations during the time lag. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on Arconics financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.  Arconics customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials.
 Certain applications of Arconics aluminum-based products compete with products made from other materials, such as steel, titanium
and composites. The willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes. For example, the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of
alternative materials to aluminum, such as titanium and composites, in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft. Additionally, the automotive industry, while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of
aluminum, may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications. Further, the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices. The willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect
the demand for certain of Arconics products, and thus adversely affect Arconics financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Arconics profitability could be adversely affected by volatility in the availability or cost of raw materials.  Arconics results of operations may be affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials, as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. The availability and
costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Arconics products may be influenced by private or government cartels, changes in world politics or regulatory requirements, labor relations between the producers and their work
forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, new or increased import duties, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. In addition, from time to time, commodity prices may fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may
withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve, which may cause periodic supply interruptions. Arconic may not be able to fully offset the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through price increases, productivity improvements
or cost reduction programs. Shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on Arconics operating results.  Arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties, which could affect Arconics reputation, business and financial statements.  The manufacture of many of Arconics products is a highly exacting and complex process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to
follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, labor unrest and environmental factors. Such problems could have an adverse impact on the Companys ability to fulfill orders
or on product performance. Product manufacturing issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure. Because of approval and license requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their

  19 


Table of Contents

suppliers, alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to the Company or its customers. Accordingly, manufacturing problems could result in significant costs
to and liability for Arconic, as well as negative publicity and damage to the Companys reputation which could impact product demand. 
Arconics business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully meet increased program demand and mitigate the impact of program
cancellations, reductions and delays.   The success of Arconics aerospace business will depend, in part, on the
success of commercial and military aircraft programs. Arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation and military aircraft programs. Many of these programs are scheduled for
production increases over the next several years. Arconics failure to successfully meet production levels could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. Similarly, cancellations, reductions or delays could also have a
material adverse effect on Arconics business.  Arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending. 
Arconics products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft and armored vehicles. Although many of the programs
in which Arconic participates extend several years, they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations. Changes in military strategy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of
these programs and could reduce the demand for Arconics products, which could adversely affect Arconics financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Arconics global operations expose the Company to risks that could adversely affect Arconics business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
Arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and
Russia. The Companys global operations are subject to a number of risks, including:   


 

 
 economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government
laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings; 
 


 

 
 geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions,
and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements;   


 

 
 war or terrorist activities;   


 

 
 major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, or
the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Arconics operations or workforce;   


 

 
 difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and 
 


 

 
 unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters. 
While the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Arconics business,
financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events.  Arconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Companys reputation, business and financial position. 
Arconic owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Companys intellectual property plays
an important role in maintaining Arconics competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Arconics competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Arconics proprietary technologies or
design around the patents Arconic owns or licenses. Further, as the Company expands its operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of

  20 


Table of Contents

others duplicating Arconics proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against Arconic relating to
intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce these rights, could adversely affect Arconics business and competitive position.  Arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates. 
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in
which Arconic operates, and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect Arconics revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other
currencies, including the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi), Euro and Russian ruble, may affect Arconics profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies, while the Companys products are generally sold in
U.S. dollars.  Arconic may not be able to realize the expected benefits from its strategy of growing its precision engineering and advanced
manufacturing businesses.  Arconic is continuing to execute on its strategy of growing its precision engineering and advanced
manufacturing business to capture profitable growth as a lightweight metals innovation leader. It is investing in its manufacturing and engineering businesses to capture growth opportunities in strong end markets like automotive and aerospace.
Arconic is building out its businesses, including by introducing innovative new products and technology solutions, and investing in expansions of capacity. Arconics recent organic growth projects include the automotive expansions in Davenport,
Iowa and Alcoa, Tennessee; the aluminum lithium capacity expansion in Lafayette, Indiana, at the Arconic Technology Center in Pennsylvania and at the Kitts Green plant in the United Kingdom; and the expansion in aerospace capabilities in La Porte,
Indiana, Hampton, Virginia and Davenport, Iowa. From time to time, Arconic also pursues growth opportunities that are strategically aligned with its objectives, such as the acquisition of the Firth Rixson business (completed in November 2014), the
acquisition of TITAL (completed in March 2015) and the acquisition of RTI International Metals (completed in July 2015). In addition, Arconic is optimizing its rolling mill portfolio as part of its strategy for profitable growth. 
Arconic has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio.
Although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to Arconic, there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Adverse factors may prevent Arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including
unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company, unanticipated costs
and liabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. The Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. 
With respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, Arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable
businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders. In addition, Arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Arconics business operations
are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures. 
There can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures or closures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or
that they will be beneficial to Arconic.  Arconic may not be able to successfully realize future targets or goals established for its
business segments, at the levels or by the dates targeted.  From time to time, Arconic may announce future targets or goals for its
business, which are based on the Companys then current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which Arconic operates. Future targets and goals reflect the Companys
beliefs and assumptions and its perception 
  21 


Table of Contents

of historical trends, then current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. As such, targets and goals are
inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. The actual outcome may be materially different. There can be no
assurance that any targets or goals established by the Company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all. Failure to achieve the targets or goals by the Company may have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.  Arconic faces significant competition, which may have an
adverse effect on profitability.  As discussed in Part I, Item 1. (BusinessCompetitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for
Arconics products are highly competitive. Arconics competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. New product offerings or new technologies in the
marketplace may compete with or replace Arconic products. The willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Arconic, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for
Arconics products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Arconics competitors or customers could affect Arconics results of operations. In addition, Arconics competitive position depends, in
part, on the Companys ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets.  A downgrade of
Arconics credit ratings could limit Arconics ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing costs, increase the pricing of its credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of its securities, trigger letter of credit
or other collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Arconics credit
ratings are important to the Companys cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate Arconics credit profile and assign debt ratings to the Company. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial
strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. Standard and Poors Ratings Services (S&P) currently rates Arconics long-term debt at BBB-, the lowest level of investment grade rating, with a stable ratings outlook, and its short-term debt at A-3 (ratings and outlook were affirmed on April 29, 2016 and
September 19, 2016). On November 1, 2016, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded Arconics long-term debt rating from Ba1, which is below investment grade, to Ba2 and its short-term debt rating from Speculative Grade
Liquidity Rating-1 to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2, based upon the completion of the Separation. Additionally, Moodys changed the outlook from negative to stable.
On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed Arconics long-term debt rating at BB+, which is below investment grade, and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch
changed the current outlook from evolving to stable based on the filing of a Form 10 registration statement related to the planned separation of Alcoa Corporation from Arconic.  There can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to Arconics ratings. Increased debt levels, macroeconomic conditions, a
deterioration in the Companys debt protection metrics, a contraction in the Companys liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on
negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agencys judgment, circumstances so warrant.  A downgrade of Arconics credit ratings
by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of Arconics securities; adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by Standard and Poors or a further downgrade by Moodys would subject
Arconic to higher costs under Arconics Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities); limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the
availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs; increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit
facilities; result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Arconic; or otherwise impair Arconics business, financial condition and results of operations.

Joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful. 
Arconic may participate in joint ventures, strategic alliance and other similar arrangements from time to time. Although the Company has, in connection
with its existing joint venture, sought to protect its interests, joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks. Whether or not Arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its
partners may:   


 

 
 have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Company; 
 


 

 
 exercise veto rights so as to block actions that Arconic believes to be in its or the joint ventures or strategic alliances best interests;
  


 

 
 take action contrary to Arconics policies or objectives with respect to its investments; or 
 


 

 
 as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, strategic alliance or
other agreements, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects.  There can be no assurance that any
Arconic joint venture or strategic alliance will be beneficial to the Company, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, currency fluctuations, political risks, or other
factors.  Arconics business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures. 
Arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities.
Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Arconics ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Arconics ability to take advantage of improved
market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Companys position in relation to its
competitors.  An adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors
could affect Arconics results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.  Arconics results of
operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. Arconic calculates income or expense for its plans
using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  These
valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Arconic to
estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Arconic is required to make an annual
measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders equity. For a discussion regarding how Arconics financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits
accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesPension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 7. (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note
U to the Consolidated Financial StatementsPension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different
regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Arconic would contribute to the pension plans.  Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the
21st Century Act (MAP- 21), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans 
  23 


Table of Contents

related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an
upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) was signed into law. HATFA extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and
modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law. BBA 2015 extends the relief period provided by HAFTA. Arconic believes that
the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Companys U.S. pension plans funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years. However, higher than expected pension
contributions due to a decline in the plans funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Companys cash flows. Adverse
capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Companys liabilities related to such plans, which could adversely affect Arconics liquidity and results of operations. 
Unanticipated changes in Arconics tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Arconics future profitability.
 Arconic is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including
the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Companys tax expense and profitability. Arconics tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and
assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Companys future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective
tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law
changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. Significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact, positive or negative, on Arconics effective tax rate,
cash tax expenditures, and deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect
Arconics financial results.  A significant portion of Arconics employees are represented by labor unions in a number of
countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see Employees in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report. While Arconic was previously successful in
renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions, Arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing
collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Arconics facilities in the future. Arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining
agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Arconics financial results. 
Arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers.
 A significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer or customers supplied by Arconic
could affect Arconics results of operations in a particular period. Arconics customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or
other difficulties in their businesses. Arconics customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Arconic, including to reduce the amount of Arconics products they purchase or to switch to
alternative suppliers. If Arconic is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected.

Arconic may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives. 
Arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments, including additive manufacturing, alloy development,
engineered finishes and product design, high speed continuous casting and rolling technology, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. For more information on Arconics research and development programs, see Research and
Development in Part I, Item 1. (Business) of this report. There can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Arconic.  Arconics human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the Companys growth.  Arconics existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience. The inability of the Company or the industry to
attract and retain such people may adversely impact Arconics ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations. Skills shortages in engineering, technical service, construction and maintenance contractors and
other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities. These shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations. 
Arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives. 
Arconic has undertaken, and may continue to undertake, productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash, including
deployment of company-wide business process models, such as Arconics degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings, and overhead cost reductions. There is no assurance that these
initiatives will be successful or beneficial to Arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.  Arconic may
be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy. 
Arconics results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements
or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Arconic. The Company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or
provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies. The Company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product
liability, health and safety, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, anti-bribery laws, competition laws and sales and trading practices. Arconic could be
subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.  While Arconic
believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and
contingencies may arise from time to time. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a
significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other
contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving
the Company, see the discussion in Part I, Item 3. (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

Table of Contents
Arconic is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations. 
Arconics operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The
costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may
impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was
lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, where no problem is currently known, at previously owned sites, sites previously operated by the Company, sites
owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future. Compliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the Company anticipates. Arconics
results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and
expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows.  Arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.  Increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as
cap-and-trade systems and additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases. New laws enacted could directly and indirectly affect Arconics customers and
suppliers (through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products) or business (through an impact on Arconics inventory availability, cost of sales, operations or demand for Arconic products), which
could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by
the Company or its customers or suppliers. Also, Arconic relies on natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities. Any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the Company
and its customers and suppliers, which could also have a negative impact on Arconics profitability.  Cyber attacks and security
breaches may threaten the integrity of Arconics intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition and results of operations.  Arconic faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated
individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses,
denial of service and other electronic security breaches.  The Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the
industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may
experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Arconics financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the
evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be
sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The
occurrence of such events could negatively impact Arconics reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased

  26 


Table of Contents

remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant
management attention and resources, and result in the diminution of the value of the Companys investment in research and development. 
Anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Arconic, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of
Arconics shareholders.  Arconics Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain, and
Pennsylvania law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with
Arconics Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Arconic is subject to Subchapters E-J of Chapter 25 and Section 2538 of Subchapter D of Chapter 25 of the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Arconic. Additionally, the Companys Articles of Incorporation authorize Arconics Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt
other anti-takeover measures without shareholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Arconics Board of Directors determines is
not in the best interests of Arconics shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Arconic common stock, or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace
incumbent directors.  Dividends on Arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in
business conditions or in other circumstances.  The existence, timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to
Arconics shareholders falls within the discretion of Arconics Board of Directors. The Arconic Board of Directors decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Arconics financial condition,
earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Companys debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that Arconics Board of
Directors deems relevant. Arconics Board of Directors may determine to reduce or eliminate Arconics common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions. 
Arconic may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially
adversely affect Arconics business.  Arconic may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result
from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (i) enabling the management of each company to more effectively pursue its own distinct
operating priorities and strategies, to focus on strengthening its core business and its unique needs, and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for long-term growth and profitability; (ii) permitting each company to allocate its
financial resources to meet the unique needs of its own business, allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to more effectively pursue its own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies;
(iii) allowing each company to more effectively articulate a clear investment thesis to attract a long-term investor base suited to its business and providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities; (iv) creating
an independent equity currency tracking each companys underlying business, affording Arconic and Alcoa Corporation direct access to the capital markets and facilitating each companys ability to consummate future acquisitions or other
restructuring transactions utilizing its common stock; (v) allowing each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets, due to the common nature of the underlying businesses; and (vi) separating and simplifying
the structures required to manage two distinct and differing underlying businesses.  Arconic may not achieve these and other anticipated
benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) Arconic may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if Alcoa Corporation were still a part of the Company because Arconics business is less
diversified than it was prior to the completion of the Separation; and (ii) as a smaller, independent company, Arconic may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those it obtained
prior to completion of the Separation. If Arconic 
  27 


Table of Contents

fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on Arconics competitive
position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Alcoa Corporation may fail to perform under various
transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation.  In connection with the Separation, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation
entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and also entered into various other agreements, including a Transition Services Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, a Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement
with respect to Arconics continuing ownership of Alcoa Corporation common stock, intellectual property license agreements, a metal supply agreement, real estate and office leases, a spare parts loan agreement and an agreement relating to the
North American packaging business. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the Company prior to
the Separation was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The
Separation and Distribution Agreement also provides that Alcoa Corporation will pay over to Arconic the proceeds in respect of the sale of Alcoa Corporations Yadkin hydroelectric project. The Transition Services Agreement provides for the
performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the Separation. Arconic will rely on Alcoa Corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Alcoa
Corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.  In connection with the Separation, Alcoa Corporation has agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities and Arconic has agreed to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities. If Arconic is
required to pay under these indemnities to Alcoa Corporation, Arconics financial results could be negatively impacted. The Alcoa Corporation indemnity may not be sufficient to hold Arconic harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which
Alcoa Corporation will be allocated responsibility, and Alcoa Corporation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.  Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation has agreed to indemnify Arconic for certain liabilities, and Arconic has agreed
to indemnify Alcoa Corporation for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that Arconic may be required to provide Alcoa Corporation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact
Arconics business. Third parties could also seek to hold Arconic responsible for any of the liabilities that Alcoa Corporation has agreed to retain. Any amounts Arconic is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other
liabilities could require Arconic to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the Companys operating business. Further, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may not be sufficient to protect Arconic against the full
amount of such liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable,
Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Arconics business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Separation could result in substantial tax liability.  It was a condition to the
Distribution that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and the Distribution received by Arconic remain valid and be
satisfactory to Arconics Board of Directors and (ii) Arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions,
as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Both of these
conditions were 
  28 


Table of Contents

satisfied prior to the Distribution. However, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as
certain representations, statements and undertakings of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or
becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Arconic or Alcoa Corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter
ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.  Notwithstanding Arconics receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as
taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In
addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions
in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Arconic of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions
do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Arconic, Alcoa
Corporation and Arconic shareholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.  If the Distribution, together with
certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Arconic shareholders who received Alcoa Corporation shares in the distribution would be
subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.  Under current U.S. federal
income tax law, even if the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution may
nevertheless be rendered taxable to Arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain post-Distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of Arconic or Alcoa Corporation. The possibility of rendering the Distribution
taxable as a result of such transactions may limit Arconics ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of Arconics business. Under the Tax Matters
Agreement that Arconic entered into with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation may be required to indemnify Arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities
or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing
shares of Alcoa Corporation stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of its businesses, (v) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa Corporation or (vi) any of Alcoa
Corporations representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or
violated. However, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may not be sufficient to protect Arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification
obligations. Moreover, even if Arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Arconic is held liable, Arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, Arconic and Arconics
subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively
affect Arconics business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  29 


Table of Contents
The value of Arconics retained interest in Alcoa Corporation is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties which could make it difficult to liquidate some or all of Arconics retained interest at favorable market prices.  In
the Separation, Arconic retained a passive ownership interest in approximately 19.9 percent of Alcoa Corporation common stock then outstanding. As of the date of this report, Arconic owned approximately 7.0 percent of Alcoa Corporation common
stock then outstanding after giving effect to a retained shares transaction.  As with any investment in a publicly traded company,
Arconics investment in Alcoa Corporation shares is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to Alcoa Corporations business and ownership of Alcoa Corporation stock, some of which are disclosed in Alcoa Corporations filings with
the SEC, as well as risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in the global economy and public equity markets generally.  Any such risk
or uncertainty may cause the share price of Alcoa Corporation common stock to fall, which could impair Arconics ability to sell its shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock in the future at a favorable market price or reduce the value of
Arconics retained interest in Alcoa Corporation.  Changes in the United Kingdoms economic and other relationships with the
European Union could adversely affect Arconic.  In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the
European Union in a national referendum (also referred to as Brexit). The ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic are difficult to predict, but because the Company currently operates and conducts business in the United Kingdom and in
Europe, the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to Arconics businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with Arconics customers and suppliers,
as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies, including the value of the British pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect Arconics financial condition,
operating results and cash flows. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The
ultimate effects of Brexit on Arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the United Kingdom and the European Union make to retain access to each others respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.

",">Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  In the ordinary course of its business, Arconic is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential.  Environmental Matters  Arconic is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA) or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The Company has
committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites. The most significant of
these matters, including the remediation of the Grasse River in Massena, NY, are discussed in the Environmental Matters section of Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Environmental Matters on pages 96-97.
 As previously reported, by an amended complaint filed April 21, 2005, Alcoa Global Fasteners, Inc. (now known as Arconic Global
Fasteners & Rings, Inc.) was added as a defendant in Orange County Water District (OCWD) v. Northrop Corporation, et al., civil action 04cc00715 (Superior Court of California, County of Orange). OCWD alleges contamination or threatened
contamination of a drinking water aquifer by Arconic, certain of the entities that preceded Arconic at the same locations as property owners and/or operators, and other current and former industrial and manufacturing businesses that operated in
Orange County in past decades. OCWD seeks to recover the cost of aquifer remediation and attorneys fees. Trial on statutory, non-jury claims commenced on February 10, 2012. On October 29,
 2013, the court issued its final Statement of Decision (SOD) in favor of Arconic and the other Phase I trial defendants dismissing
the statutory law liability claims. On June 20, 2014, following the full briefing by the parties, the trial court entered final judgment in favor of Arconic and the other trial defendants on the remaining tort claims. On

Table of Contents

August 18, 2014, the OCWD appealed the dismissal of the statutory law claims and common law claims (except for negligence). The appellate argument has not been scheduled, but is likely to
occur by the first half of 2017 and could produce a decision during the second half of 2017.  Other Matters 
As previously reported, Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury
as a result of occupational or other exposure to asbestos. Arconic, its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries have numerous insurance policies over many years that provide coverage for asbestos related claims. Arconic has significant insurance
coverage and believes that Arconics reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations, cash flows,
and financial position of the Company.  Tax  Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, the Company shares responsibility with
Alcoa Corporation for, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the Company with respect to, the following matter.  As
previously reported, in September 2010, following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years, an assessment was received as a result of Spains tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a
Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. An appeal of this assessment in Spains Central Tax Administrative Court by the Company was denied in October 2013. In December 2013, the Company filed an appeal of the assessment in
Spains National Court.  Additionally, following a corporate income tax audit of the same Spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax
years, Spains tax authorities issued an assessment in July 2013, similarly disallowing certain interest deductions. In August 2013, the Company filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spains Central Tax Administrative Court, which
was denied in January 2015. The Company filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spains National Court in March 2015.  The combined
assessments (remeasured for a tax rate change enacted in November 2014) total $258 million ( 246 million). On January 16, 2017, Spains National Court issued a decision in favor of the Company related to the assessment
received in September 2010. It is not yet known if Spains tax authorities will appeal this decision. Spains National Court has not yet rendered a decision related to the assessment received in July 2013. 
The Company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through Spains
court system. However, in the event the Company is unsuccessful, a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which would be shared between the Company and Alcoa
Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement. Additionally, it is possible that the Company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2009. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome
for this matter.  Matters Previously Reported  Alcoa Corporation 
We have included the matters discussed below in which the Company remains party to proceedings relating to Alcoa Corporation in accordance with SEC
regulations. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated October 31, 2016, entered into between the Company and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation, provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Alcoa Corporation
for claims subject to indemnification. The Company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it. 
Squaw Creek Mine Proceedings  As previously reported, in October 2006, in Barnett, et al. v. Alcoa and Alcoa Fuels, Inc., Warrick Circuit Court, County of Warrick, Indiana; 87-C01-0601-PL-499, 41 plaintiffs sued Arconic Inc. and a subsidiary, asserting claims similar to those asserted in Musgrave v.
Alcoa, et al., Warrick Circuit Court, County of Warrick, Indiana; 87-
  32 


Table of Contents

C01-0601-CT-006. In Musgrave, in January 2006, Arconic Inc. and a
subsidiary were sued by an individual, on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated, claiming harm from alleged exposure to waste that had been disposed in designated pits at the Squaw Creek Mine in the 1970s. In November 2007, Arconic
and its subsidiary filed a motion to dismiss the Barnett cases. In October 2008, the Warrick County Circuit Court granted Arconics motions to dismiss, dismissing all claims arising out of alleged occupational exposure to wastes at the Squaw
Creek Mine, but in November 2008, the trial court clarified its ruling, indicating that the order does not dispose of plaintiffs personal injury claims based upon alleged recreational or
non-occupational exposure. Plaintiffs also filed a second amended complaint in response to the courts orders granting Arconics motion to dismiss. On July 7, 2010, the court granted
the parties joint motions for a general continuance of trial settings. Discovery in this matter remains stayed. The Company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because plaintiffs have
merely alleged that their medical condition is attributable to exposure to materials at the Squaw Creek Mine but no further information is available due to the discovery stay.  St. Croix Proceedings  Abednego and Abraham cases. As previously reported,
on January 14, 2010, Arconic was served with a multi-plaintiff action complaint involving several thousand individual persons claiming to be residents of St. Croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from Hurricane
Georges or winds blowing material from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (SCA) facility on the island of St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) since the time of the hurricane. This complaint, Abednego, et al. v. Alcoa, et al. was filed in the
Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Arconic and SCA to remove the case to federal court, the case has been lodged in the Superior Court. The complaint names as defendants the same entities
that were sued in a February 1999 action arising out of the impact of Hurricane Georges on the island and added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property.  Also as previously reported, on March 1, 2012, Arconic was served with a separate multi-plaintiff action complaint involving approximately 200 individual persons alleging claims essentially identical to
those set forth in the Abednego v. Alcoa complaint. This complaint, Abraham, et al. v. Alcoa, et al., was filed on behalf of plaintiffs previously dismissed in the federal court proceeding involving the original litigation over Hurricane Georges
impacts. The matter was originally filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix Division, on March 30, 2011.  Arconic and
other defendants in the Abraham and Abednego cases filed or renewed motions to dismiss each case in March 2012 and August 2012 following service of the Abraham complaint on Arconic and remand of the Abednego complaint to Superior Court,
respectively. By order dated August 10, 2015, the Superior Court dismissed plaintiffs complaints without prejudice to re-file the complaints individually, rather than as a multi-plaintiff filing.
The order also preserves the defendants grounds for dismissal if new, individual complaints are filed.  Other Contingencies
 In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or
asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, and tax matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined
because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Companys liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on
facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company.

Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.  The Companys common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the
Separation of Alcoa Corporation from the Company, the Companys common stock traded under the symbol AA. In connection with the separation, on November 1, 2016, the Company changed its stock symbol and its common stock began
trading under the symbol ARNC.  On October 5, 2016, the Companys common shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of the Companys outstanding and authorized shares of common stock (the Reverse Stock Split). As a result of the Reverse Stock
Split, every 3 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock
outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares, and proportionately decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1.8 billion to 0.6 billion shares. The Companys
common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on October 6, 2016.  On November 1, 2016, the Company completed
the Separation of its business into two independent, publicly traded companies: the Company and Alcoa Corporation. The Separation was effected by means of a pro rata distribution by the Company of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation
common stock to the Companys shareholders. The Companys shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the Record Date) received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares
of the Companys common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company retained 19.9% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Separation.  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices and quarterly dividend amounts per share of the Companys common stock as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange, adjusted to take into account the Reverse Stock Split effected on October 6, 2016. The prices listed below for the fourth quarter of 2016 do not reflect any adjustment for the impact of the separation of Alcoa Corporation from the
Company on November 1, 2016, and therefore are not comparable to pre-separation prices from earlier periods.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and aluminum prices; shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) 
Overview  Our Business  Arconic (the Company) is a global leader in lightweight metals
engineering and manufacturing. Arconics innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and
gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications.  Arconic is a global company operating in 19 countries. Based upon the
country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 63% and 26%, respectively, of Arconics sales in 2016. In addition, Arconic has operating activities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Russia, among others.
Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. 
Management Review of 2016 and Outlook for the Future  Separation Transaction. On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced separation of its business into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa
Corporation. Following the Separation Transaction, Arconic comprises the Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Maaden Rolling Company), the Engineered Products and
Solutions, and the Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation comprises the Alumina and Primary Metals segments, the rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% equity ownership stake in the Maaden Rolling
Company in Saudi Arabia.  The Separation Transaction was effected by the distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Alcoa Corporation
common stock to the Companys shareholders (the Distribution). The Companys shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the Record Date) received one share of Alcoa Corporation
common stock for every three shares of the Companys common stock held as of the Record Date. The Company distributed 146,159,428 shares of common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the Distribution and retained 36,311,767 shares, or approximately
19.9%, of the common stock of Alcoa Corporation immediately following the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, Alcoa Corporation is now an independent public company trading under the symbol AA on the New York Stock Exchange,
and the Company trades under the symbol ARNC on the New York Stock Exchange.  On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several
agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax
Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to
Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration
Rights Agreement.

Table of Contents
Review of 2016 Operating Results and 2017 Outlook. In 2016, Arconics revenues were stable
compared to 2015 as volume growth in aerospace due to the RTI acquisition (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information under Results of Operations below) and volume growth in automotive markets were offset by lower demand in
commercial transportation and packaging markets in addition to lower aluminum prices impacting Global Rolled Products. Despite stable revenues, after-tax operating income (ATOI) was higher in each segment in 2016 versus 2015. Net
productivity improvements across all operations exceeded cost headwinds and an unfavorable product mix as well as pricing pressures with various aerospace customers and in the global can sheet market. 
Arconics 2016 results were negatively impacted by costs associated with the Separation Transaction as well as significant tax valuation allowance
charges related to an assessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets including Alcoa Corporations net deferred tax assets and Arconics foreign tax credits in the U.S. Additionally, significant restructuring charges (see
Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations below) caused unfavorable impacts in the 2016 results.  Management continued its
focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Management has also intensified its focus on capital efficiency, with an owners
mindset. This focus and the related results enabled Arconic to end 2016 with a solid financial position.  The following financial information
reflects certain key measures of Arconics 2016 results:   


 

 
 Sales of $12,394 and Loss from continuing operations of $1,062, or $2.58 per diluted share; 
 


 

 
 Total segment after-tax operating income of $1,087, an increase of 10% from 2015; 
 


 

 
 Cash from operations of $870 (includes Alcoa Corporation results of operations for the ten months ended October 31, 2016);
  


 

 
 Capital expenditures of $1,125 (includes Alcoa Corporation capital expenditures for the ten months ended October 31, 2016);
  


 

 
 Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,863;   


 

 
 Total Debt of $8,084, a decrease in total debt of $743 from 2015; and 
 


 

 
 Depreciation and amortization of $535, an increase of 5% from 2015.  In 2017, management is projecting that sales will be stable to down 5% as the unfavorable impact from the North American packaging ramp-down (approximately $400 reduction in sales from $552 in 2016 to
approximately $150 in 2017) will continue (see Restructuring and Other Charges under Results of Operations below). Each segment is anticipated to grow sales in 2017 excluding the impact of ramping down North American packaging in the Global Rolled
Products segment. In aerospace, it is anticipated that the favorable impact of share gains on new platforms and engines will be somewhat offset by airframe destocking, supply chain risks, and engine ramp-up challenges that are expected to continue
throughout 2017. Management also expects strong growth in automotive sheet as well as growth in the building and construction market. Finally, it is anticipated that the decline of North American heavy duty truck build rates will continue, although
not quite at the same level as 2016; that the mining and oil and gas markets will not recover in 2017; and that pressures from market mix and competitive pricing will continue. 
  38 


Table of Contents
Looking ahead over the next year, management will continue to focus on improving operating performance
through cost reductions, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation. Each of the segments are projected to achieve stable to improved operating margins through net productivity savings in 2017, including from procurement and overhead
programs.  On a company-wide basis, management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2017: 
 


 

 
 Improving Adjusted
EBITDA(1) margin(2) excluding costs associated with the Separation Transaction by
approximately 130 basis points to 15%;   


 

 
 Achieving return on net assets (RONA)(2) of approximately 9%, or 190 basis points better than 2016; 
 


 

 
 Spending no more than $650 on capital expenditures;   


 

 
 Reducing debt by $1,000; and   


 

 
 Generating cash from operations that will exceed capital expenditures by a minimum of $350. 
 


(1) 
 Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is calculated as net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and
amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization.



(2) 
 Expectations for adjusted EBITDA margin and RONA on a forward-looking basis are being provided, however, a reconciliation of the differences between
the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures generally is not available without unreasonable effort. 
Results of Operations 
Earnings Summary  Loss from continuing
operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was $1,062 for 2016, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared with a loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $157 for 2015, or $0.54 per share. The
decrease in results of $905 was primarily due to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the Separation Transaction primarily offset by a full-year effect of 2015 acquisitions (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment
Information below) and productivity improvements across all segments.  Loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling
interests was $157 for 2015, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared with a loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $61 for 2014, or $0.21 per share. The decrease in results of $96 was mostly due to
unfavorable price and product mix across all segments, net unfavorable foreign currency movements, and higher costs. These negative impacts were partially offset by net productivity improvements, higher volume across all segments, and lower charges
and expenses related to a number of portfolio actions (e.g., divestitures and acquisitions).  SalesSales for 2016 were $12,394
compared with sales of $12,413 in 2015, a decline of $19, or less than 1%. The relatively flat performance was the result of a full-year effect of two 2015 acquisitions in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment and automotive volume increases
in the Global Rolled Products segment, offset by the ramp-down of the Tennessee packaging business and the impact of metal prices in the Global Rolled Products segment and unfavorable price and product mix across all segments. 
Sales for 2015 were $12,413 compared with sales of $12,542 in 2014, a decline of $129, or 1%. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of sales
related to capacity that was closed or sold in the Global Rolled Products segment (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below), a lower average realized price for aluminum in the Global Rolled Products segment and unfavorable foreign
currency movements across all segments. These negative impacts were partially offset by the addition of sales from three acquired businesses (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below), higher volume across all segments, and
favorable product mix in the Global Rolled Products segment. 
  39 


Table of Contents
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)COGS as a percentage of Sales was 79.2% in 2016 compared with 81.4% in
2015. The primary drivers in the improvement in COGS as a percentage of sales were productivity gains across all segments and higher volume in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment due to the benefit of a full-year effect of two 2015
acquisitions. This benefit was somewhat offset by overall cost increases across all segments and unfavorable pricing and product mix impacts primarily in the Engineered Products and Solutions and Global Rolled Products segments. 
COGS as a percentage of Sales was 81.4% in 2015 compared with 82.5% in 2014. The percentage was favorably impacted by net productivity improvements and
higher volume across all segments and a favorable LIFO (last in, first out) adjustment due to lower prices for aluminum in the Global Rolled Products segment. These positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable price and product mix across
all segments and higher costs.  Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses (SG&A)  SG&A expenses were $942, or
7.6% of Sales, in 2016 compared with $765, or 6.2% of Sales, in 2015. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to costs related to the Separation Transaction of $193 in 2016, an increase of $169 from 2015 separation costs. 
SG&A expenses were $765, or 6.2% of Sales, in 2015 compared with $770, or 6.1% of Sales, in 2014. The relatively flat expense was principally the
result of favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, the absence of SG&A related to closed and sold locations, and lower acquisition costs ($15), primarily offset by expenses for professional and consulting services
related to the Separation Transaction ($24) and SG&A related to inorganic growth in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. 
Research and Development Expenses (R&D)R&D expenses were $132 in 2016 compared with $169 in 2015 and $123 in 2014. The decrease in
2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by the decrease in spending for the Micromill in San Antonio, TX which was completed in 2015 and began production of automotive sheet, on a limited basis, for the Global Rolled Products segment. The increase
in 2015 as compared to 2014 was mainly driven by additional spending related to the upgrade of the Micromill.  Provision for
Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)The provision for D&A was $535 in 2016 compared with $508 in 2015. The increase of $27, or 5.3%, related to a full year of D&A related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 (see
Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below).  The provision for D&A was $508 in 2015 compared with $436 in 2014. The
increase of $72, or 16.5%, related primarily to new D&A ($93) associated with three acquisitions that occurred from November 2014 through July 2015 (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below). This increase was partially
offset by the absence of D&A related to the divestiture and/or permanent closure of six rolling mills (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below).  Impairment of GoodwillIn 2015, Arconic recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $25, related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil (see
Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below).  Restructuring and Other ChargesRestructuring and other charges
for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 were comprised of the following:

Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that
specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans.  
2016 Actions. In 2016, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $155 ($114 after-tax), which were comprised of the following
components: $57 ($46 after-tax) for costs related to the exit of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K.; $37 ($24 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down a can sheet facility; $20 ($14 after-tax) for
costs related to the closures of five facilities, primarily in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including the separation of approximately 280 employees; $53 ($33 after-tax) for
other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,315 employees (30 in TCS, 1,045 in EPS, 30 in GRP and 210 in Corporate); $11 ($8 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for the sale of Remmele Medical,
an RTI subsidiary; $2 ($1 after-tax) for a pension settlement; and $25 ($12 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.  In 2016, management made the decision to exit certain legacy Firth Rixson facilities in the U.K. Costs related to these actions included asset impairments and accelerated depreciation of $51; other exit
costs of $4; and $2 for the separation of 60 employees.  Also in 2016, management approved the shutdown and demolition of the can sheet
facility in Tennessee upon completion of the Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below). Costs related to this action included $21 in asset impairments; $9 in other exit
costs; and $7 for the separation of 145 employees. The other exit costs of $9 represent $4 in asset retirement obligations and $3 in environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish the
can sheet facility in Tennessee, and $2 in other exit costs.  As of December 31, 2016, approximately 880 of the 1,800 employees were
separated. The remaining separations for 2016 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2017. In 2016, cash payments of $16 were made against layoff reserves related to 2016 restructuring programs. 
2015 Actions. In 2015, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $214 ($192 after-tax), which were comprised of the following
components: a $136 ($134 after-tax) net loss related to the March 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in Russia and post-closing adjustments associated with the December 2014 divestitures of three rolling mills located in Spain and France; $97 ($70
after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,505 employees (425 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, 590 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 90 in the Global Rolled Products segment, and
400 in Corporate); an $18 ($13 after-tax) gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in Australia that was permanently closed in December 2014 (see 2014 Actions below); a net charge of $7 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous
items; and $8 ($3 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.  As of December 31, 2016,
approximately 1,100 of the 1,240 (previously 1,505) employees were separated. The total number of employees associated with 2015 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other
positions within Arconic and natural attrition. The remaining separations for 2015 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2017. In 2016 and 2015, cash payments of $55 and $18, respectively, were made against layoff
reserves related to 2015 restructuring programs.  2014 Actions. In 2014, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $314 ($249
after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $154 ($107 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down and demolish two rolling mills (see below); a $111 ($112 after-tax) net loss primarily for the
divestitures of three rolling mills in Spain and France; $49 ($28 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,035 employees (470 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 410 in the Transportation and
Construction 
  41 


Table of Contents

Solutions segment, 45 in the Global Rolled Products segment, and 110 in Corporate); a net charge of $10 ($7 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $10 ($5 after-tax) for the reversal of a
number of layoff reserves related to prior periods.  In early 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of Arconics two rolling
mills in Australia, Point Henry and Yennora. This decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both Australia and Asia. The two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200,000 metric-tons-per-year and
were closed by the end of 2014. Costs related to the shutdown of the two rolling mills included $56 for the separation of approximately 470 employees; accelerated depreciation of $58 as the rolling mills continued to operate during 2014; asset
impairments of $7 representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $33 in other exit costs. Additionally, in 2014, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were
written down to their net realizable value, resulting in a charge of $13 ($9 after-tax), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs of $33 represent $18 in environmental
remediation and $8 in asset retirement obligations, both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in Australia, and $7 in other related costs, including supplier and customer
contract-related costs. Demolition and remediation activities related to the two rolling mills began in mid-2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018.  As of December 31, 2016, the separations associated with 2014 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, cash payments of $3, $27, and $54, respectively, were made
against layoff reserves related to 2014 restructuring programs.  Arconic does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of
its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows:

 Interest ExpenseInterest expense was $499 in 2016 compared with $473 in 2015. The increase of $26, or 5%,
was primarily due to debt issuance costs of $9 that were expensed in connection with the Separation Transaction and costs associated with the early redemption of $750 of 5.55% Notes due February 2017, completed on December 30, 2016, which
included a $3 purchase premium, and a full-year of interest related to RTI International Metals, Inc. (RTI) debt of $6.  Interest expense was
$473 in 2015 compared with $442 in 2014. The increase of $31, or 7%, was primarily due to an 8% higher average debt level, somewhat offset by the absence of fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge
term loan facility related to the then-planned acquisition of Firth Rixson ($13see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information below). The higher average debt level was mostly attributable to higher outstanding long-term debt due
to the September 2014 issuance of $1,250 in 5.125% Notes, the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the Firth Rixson acquisition.  Other Income, NetOther income, net was $94 in 2016 compared with $28 in 2015. The increase of $66 was mainly the result of a favorable adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability and a
post-closing adjustment, both of which related to the November 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson ($76), and favorable foreign currency movements ($55). These items were partially offset by the absence of gains on the sales of land in the United
States and equity investment in a China rolling mill ($38) in 2015.  Other income, net was $28 in 2015 compared with $5 in 2014. The increase
of $23 was mainly the result of a gain on the sale of land around Arconics former Sherwin, TX refinery site ($19) and the remaining equity investment in a 
  42 


Table of Contents

China rolling mill ($19) and a favorable change in deferred compensation. These items were somewhat offset by the absence of a gain on a portion of an equity investment in a China rolling mill
($14) and an unfavorable change in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance.  Income TaxesArconics
effective tax rate was 356.5% (provision on income) in 2016 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation
allowances related to the Separation Transaction (see Income Taxes in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), a $95 tax charge associated with the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies whose tax basis was less than the
redemption amount resulting in a taxable gain, a $51 net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate and tax law changes, a $34 unfavorable tax impact related to certain separation costs which are
nondeductible for income tax purposes, somewhat offset by a $39 discrete income tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances in Canada and Russia, a $38 tax benefit related to currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income, and
a $26 favorable tax impact associated with non-taxable settlement proceeds and earn-out liability adjustments in connection with the Firth Rixson acquisition.  Arconics effective tax rate was 185.2% (provision on income) in 2015 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate
principally due to a $190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Iceland (see Income Taxes in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), a $25 impairment of goodwill (see Impairment
of Goodwill above) that is nondeductible for income tax purposes, a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in Russia (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below) for which no tax benefit was recognized, and a $34 net discrete income tax
charge as described below.  In 2015, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), the former joint venture owned 60% by Arconic and 40% by
Alumina Limited, recognized an $85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Suriname (see Income Taxes in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), which were related mostly to employee benefits
and tax loss carryforwards. Arconic also had a $51 deferred tax liability related to its 60%-share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by AWAC. 
Arconics effective tax rate was 154.0% (provision on income) in 2014 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate
differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate mainly due to restructuring charges related to operations in Australia (benefit at a lower tax rate) (see Restructuring and Other Charges above), a $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interests) discrete income
tax charge related to a tax rate change in Brazil (see below), a loss on the sale of three rolling mills in Europe (no tax benefit) (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information below), and a $27 ($16 after noncontrolling interests) discrete
income tax charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Spain due to a November 2014 enacted tax rate change (from 30% in 2014 to 28% in 2015 to 25% in 2016). These items were somewhat offset by foreign income taxed
in lower rate jurisdictions and a $9 discrete income tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance related to operations in Germany due to the initiation of a tax planning strategy.  In December 2011, one of Arconics former subsidiaries in Brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations. During 2013, the application was amended and
re-filed and, separately, a similar application was filed for another one of Arconics former subsidiaries in Brazil. The deadline for the Brazilian government to deny the application was July 11, 2014. Since Arconic did not receive notice
that its applications were denied, the tax holiday took effect automatically on July 12, 2014. As a result, the tax rate applicable to qualified holiday income for these subsidiaries decreased significantly (from 34% to 15.25%), resulting in
future cash tax savings over the 10-year holiday period (retroactively effective as of January 1, 2013). Additionally, a portion of one of the subsidiaries net deferred tax asset that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new
tax rate (the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the subsidiarys future earnings not subject to the tax holiday). This remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that
subsidiarys net deferred tax assets and a noncash charge to earnings of $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interests).

Table of Contents
Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2017 will be between 32% and 35%. However, business
portfolio actions, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stock-based payment
awards, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate.  Segment Information
 Arconics operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments: Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions, and
Transportation and Construction Solutions (see below). Segment performance under Arconics management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income
(ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective
segmentgenerally when the price of metal increases, metal lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases, metal lag is unfavorable); interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling
expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit
eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment ATOI.
 ATOI for all reportable segments totaled $1,087 in 2016, $986 in 2015, and $983 in 2014. The following information provides shipment, sales
and ATOI data for each reportable segment, as well as certain realized price data, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K
for additional information.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, Arconics segment reporting metric will change from ATOI to Adjusted
EBITDA.  Global Rolled Products(1)

 Excludes the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were
previously part of the Global Rolled Products segment but became part of Alcoa Corporation effective November 1, 2016.

 Generally, average realized price per metric ton of aluminum includes two elements: a) the price of metal (the underlying base metal component based on
quoted prices from the LME, plus a regional premium which represents the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with physical delivery of metal to a particular region), and b) the conversion price, which represents the
incremental price over the metal price component that is associated with converting primary aluminum into sheet and plate. In this circumstance, the metal price component is a pass-through to this segments customers with limited exception
(e.g., fixed-priced contracts, certain regional premiums).  The Global Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and
plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in
the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of
sales of sheet 
  44

and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are
mostly the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro, the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and the British pound.  In March 2015, Arconic
completed the sale of a rolling mill located in Belaya Kalitva, Russia to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stupino Titanium Company. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the Global
Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $130 in 2014 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 1,870 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above. 
In December 2014, Arconic completed the sale of three rolling mills located in Spain (Alicante and Amorebieta) and France (Castelsarrasin) to a
subsidiary of Atlas Holdings LLC. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mills were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mills combined generated sales of approximately $500 in
2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 750 employees. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above.  In
February 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of Arconics two rolling mills in Australia, Point Henry and Yennora. This decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both Australia and Asia. The
two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmt-per-year and were closed by the end of 2014. See Restructuring and Other Charges in Results of Operations above.  Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment declined 7% in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the ramp-down of Tennessee packaging ($251); lower aluminum prices; and lower demand in
the industrial products, packaging, commercial aerospace, commercial transportation, and North American heavy duty truck markets. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume in the automotive market. 
Third-party sales for this segment declined 17% in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by the absence of sales ($1,052) from six rolling mills in
Australia, Spain, Russia, and France (see above), unfavorable pricing, mostly due to a decrease in metal prices (both LME and regional premium components), and unfavorable foreign currency movements, mainly the result of a weaker euro, Russian
ruble, and Brazilian real. These negative impacts were somewhat offset by increased demand of the remaining rolling portfolio and favorable product mix (automotive and aerospace versus industrial products). The volume improvement of the remaining
portfolio was largely attributable to the automotive (North America) and can sheet packaging (China) end markets, slightly offset by lower demand in the industrial products end market.  ATOI for the Global Rolled Products segment increased $44, or 20%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by strong productivity improvements, which significantly exceeded cost increases, partially
offset by lower pricing, primarily due to overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet market, unfavorable product mix and lower volumes as detailed above.  ATOI for this segment increased $1 in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily attributable to net productivity improvements across most businesses and higher volumes principally driven by higher demand in the
automotive end market, offset by unfavorable price and product mix, largely the result of overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet packaging end market, and higher costs related to growth projects, including research and development as
Arconic develops and qualifies products from a new Micromill production process and the ramp-up of the Tennessee automotive expansion. 
On November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick,
IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon the completion of the Separation Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic will provide a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its
facility in Tennessee through the expected end date of the contract, 
  45 


Table of Contents

December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation will supply all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic will process the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end
customer. Tolling revenue for the two months ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $37 million.  In 2017, demand in the
automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminum-intensive vehicles. Demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat in 2017 as the ramp up of new programs is
offset by customer destocking and lower build rates for aluminum intensive wide-body programs. Sales to the packaging market are expected to decline due to continuing pricing pressure within this market and the ramp-down of the North American
packaging operations. Net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue.  Engineered Products and

 The Engineered Products and Solutions segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace (commercial and
defense), commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings (nickel superalloys,
titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks), and extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors.
More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the oil and gas, industrial
products, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets. Generally, the sales and costs and
expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are mostly the U.S. dollar, British pound and the euro.  In July 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of RTI, a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical device end
markets. The purpose of the acquisition was to expand Arconics range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials, primarily related to the aerospace end market. In 2014, RTI generated net sales of $794 and had
approximately 2,600 employees. The operating results and assets and liabilities of RTI have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition.  In March 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of TITAL, a privately held aerospace castings company with approximately 650 employees based in Germany. TITAL produces aluminum and titanium investment
casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets. In 2014, TITAL generated sales of approximately $100. The purpose of the acquisition was to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish
titanium-casting capabilities in Europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. The operating results and assets and liabilities of TITAL have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition.
 In November 2014, Arconic completed the acquisition of Firth Rixson, a global leader in aerospace jet engine components. Firth Rixson
manufactures rings, forgings, and metal products for the aerospace end market, as well as other markets requiring highly-engineered material applications. The purpose of the acquisition was to strengthen Arconics aerospace business and
position the Company to capture additional aerospace growth with a broader range of high-growth, value-add jet engine components. Firth Rixson generated sales of approximately $970 in 2014 and had 13 operating facilities in the United States, United
Kingdom, Europe, and Asia employing approximately 2,400 people combined. The operating results and assets and liabilities of Firth Rixson have been included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition.

Table of Contents
Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment improved 7% in 2016 compared with 2015,
primarily attributable to higher third-party sales of the two acquired businesses ($457), primarily related to the aerospace end market, and increased demand from the industrial gas turbine end market, partially offset by lower volumes in the oil
and gas end market and commercial transportation end market as well as pricing pressures in aerospace.  Third-party sales for this segment
improved 27% in 2015 compared with 2014, largely attributable to the third-party sales ($1,310) of the three acquired businesses (see above), and higher volumes in this segments legacy businesses, both of which were primarily related to the
aerospace end market. These positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, principally driven by a weaker euro.  ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased $47, or 8%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily related to net productivity improvements across all businesses as well as the volume
increase from both the RTI acquisition and organic revenue growth, partially offset by a lower margin product mix and pricing pressures in the aerospace end market.  ATOI for this segment increased $16, or 3%, in 2015 compared with 2014, principally the result of net productivity improvements across most businesses, a positive contribution from acquisitions, and
overall higher volumes in this segments legacy businesses. These positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable price and product mix, higher costs related to growth projects, and net unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily
related to a weaker euro.  In 2017, demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, driven by the ramp up of new
aerospace engine platforms, somewhat offset by continued customer destocking and engine ramp-up challenges. Demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing ramp-up of certain aerospace programs. Additionally, net
productivity improvements are anticipated while pricing pressure across all markets is likely to continue.

 The Transportation and Construction Solutions segment produces products that are used mostly in the nonresidential
building and construction and commercial transportation end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold both directly to customers and
through distributors. A small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations,
which are primarily the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Brazilian real.  Third-party sales for the Transportation and Construction Solutions
segment decreased 4% in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by lower demand from the North American commercial transportation end market, which was partially offset by rising demand from the building and construction end market. 
Third-party sales for this segment decreased 7% in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency movements, principally
caused by a weaker euro and Brazilian real, and lower volume related to the building and construction end market, somewhat offset by higher volume related to the commercial transportation end market. 
ATOI for the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment increased $10, or 6%, in 2016 compared with 2015, principally driven by net productivity
improvements across all businesses and growth in the building and construction segment, partially offset by lower demand in the North American heavy duty truck and Brazilian markets. 
  47 


Table of Contents
ATOI for this segment declined $14, or 8%, in 2015 compared with 2014, mainly due to higher costs, net
unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily related to a weaker euro and Brazilian real, and unfavorable price and product mix. These negative impacts were mostly offset by net productivity improvements across all businesses. 
In 2017, we expect continued growth in the North American and European non-residential building and construction end markets and continued demand for
innovative products. It will be partially offset by the expected year-over-year decline in the North American build rates in the commercial transportation end market. Additionally, net productivity improvements are anticipated. 
Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic  Items required to reconcile total segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Arconic include: the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created
when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment  generally when the price of metal increases, metal lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases, metal lag is
unfavorable); interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, corporate research and development expenses,
along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated
effective tax rate, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income.  The following table

 The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and Consolidated net (loss) income
attributable to Arconic for 2016 compared with 2015 consisted of:   


 

 
 a change in the impact of LIFO, mostly due to higher aluminum prices, driven by higher base metal prices (LME) (increase in price at December 31,
2016 indexed to December 31, 2015 compared to a decrease in price at December 31, 2015 indexed to December 31, 2014);   


 

 
 a change in Metal price lag, the result of higher prices for aluminum; 
 


 

 
 an increase in Interest expense, due to debt issuance costs expensed associated with the Separation Transaction, a full year of interest related to the
RTI debt and costs associated with the early redemption of $750 of 5.55% Notes due February 2017, completed on December 30, 2016, which included a purchase premium; 
  48 


Table of Contents


 

 
 an increase in Corporate expense, largely attributable to an increase in costs related to the Separation Transaction ($134), partially offset by
decreases in corporate research and development expenses and other various expenses;   


 

 
 a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, due to fewer portfolio actions; and 
 


 

 
 a decrease in Other, primarily due to a charge for tax valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction ($1,267), slightly offset by a
favorable adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment, both of which related to the November 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson ($76).  The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and Consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Arconic for 2015 compared with 2014 consisted of: 
 


 

 
 a change in the impact of LIFO, mostly due to lower prices for aluminum, driven by both lower base metal prices (LME) and regional premiums (decrease
in price at December 31, 2015 indexed to December 31, 2014 compared to an increase in price at December 31, 2014 indexed to December 31, 2013); 
 


 

 
 a change in Metal price lag, the result of lower prices for aluminum; 
 


 

 
 an increase in Interest expense, principally caused by an 8% higher average debt level, which was largely attributable to higher outstanding long-term
debt due to the September 2014 issuance of $1,250 in 5.125% Notes, somewhat offset by the absence of fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the then-planned
acquisition of Firth Rixson ($8);   


 

 
 a decline in Corporate expense, largely attributable to decreases in various expenses, including lower acquisition costs ($13), partially offset by
expenses related to the Separation Transaction ($24);   


 

 
 a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, mostly the result of lower restructuring and other charges associated with a number of portfolio actions
(e.g. divestitures); and   


 

 
 a change in Other, primarily due to a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the United States and
Iceland ($190) partially offset by gains on various asset sales, a tax rate change in Brazil, and a net benefit for a number of small items.  Environmental Matters  See the Environmental Matters section of Note L to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Arconic maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. In 2016, as has been the focus since 2008, management
initiated actions to significantly improve Arconics cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively. Such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs,
working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. In 2017, this approach is expected to continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds
capital expenditures by more than $350 and debt pay down of approximately $1 billion.  Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from
operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Arconics operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
below.  At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of Arconic were $1,863, of which $640 was held outside the United States. Arconic
has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Companys growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the United States. As such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating
cash held in foreign jurisdictions.

The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows has not been restated for discontinued operations, therefore the
discussion below concerning Cash from Operations, Financing Activities, and Investing Activities includes the results of both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation up through the completion of the Separation Transaction on November 1, 2016. 
Cash from Operations  Cash provided
from operations in 2016 was $870 compared with $1,582 in 2015. The decrease of $712, or 45%, was primarily due to lower operating results (net loss plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) of $985 and a negative change in working
capital of $104 and noncurrent liabilities of $21, partially offset by a positive change associated with noncurrent assets of $218 and a decrease in pension contributions of $180.  The components of the negative change in working capital were as follows:   


 

 
 an unfavorable change of $450 in receivables;   


 

 
 a positive change of $35 in inventories;   


 

 
 an unfavorable change of $122 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; 
 


 

 
 a positive change of $322 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of the impact of purchasing metal from Alcoa Corporation and the timing of
payments;   


 

 
 a positive change of $43 in accrued expenses; and   


 

 
 a favorable change of $68 in taxes, including income taxes.  Cash provided from operations in 2015 was $1,582 compared with $1,674 in 2014. The decrease of $92, or 5%, was due to a negative change in noncurrent assets of $328, lower operating results (net (loss)
income plus net add-back for noncash transactions in earnings) and a negative change in noncurrent liabilities of $18, mostly offset by a positive change associated with working capital of $572 and lower pension contributions of $31. 
The components of the positive change in working capital were as follows: 
 


 

 
 a favorable change of $524 in receivables, mostly driven by lower customer sales as a result of closed, divested, and curtailed locations and lower
metal prices;   


 

 
 a positive change of $291 in inventories, largely attributable to the absence of inventory build related to the ramp-up of automotive production at the
Davenport, IA plant and customer requirements related to smelters (Alcoa Corporation) that have been curtailed or shut down;   


 

 
 a favorable change of $71 in prepaid expenses and other current assets; 
 


 

 
 a negative change of $346 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of timing of payments; 
 


 

 
 a positive change of $14 in accrued expenses, mainly caused by a smaller payment to the United States government due to the resolution of a legal
matter (Alcoa Corporation); and   


 

 
 a favorable change of $18 in taxes, including income taxes.  The unfavorable change in noncurrent assets was mostly related to a $300 prepayment made under a natural gas supply agreement in Australia (Alcoa Corporation). 
Financing Activities  Cash used for
financing activities was $754 in 2016 compared with cash used from financing of $441 in 2015 and cash provided from financing activities of $2,250 in 2014. 
  50 


Table of Contents
The use of cash of $754 in 2016 was principally the result of $2,734 in payments on debt, mostly related to
the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilitates (see below) and the repayment in December 2016 of $750 of outstanding principal of 5.55% notes due February 2017; $228 in dividends to shareholders; and $175 in net cash paid to
noncontrolling interests. These items were mostly offset by $1,962 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowing under certain revolving credit facilities and $421 in net cash transferred from Alcoa Corporation at the
completion of the Separation Transaction.  The use of cash in 2015 was principally the result of $2,030 in payments on debt, mostly related to
the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below) and the repayment of convertible notes assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of RTI (see below); $223 in dividends paid to shareholders; and $104 in net cash
paid to a noncontrolling interest. These items were mostly offset by $1,901 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below). 
The source of cash in 2014 was mostly driven by $2,878 in additions to debt, driven by $1,238 in net proceeds from the issuance of new senior debt
securities used for the acquisition of Firth Rixson (see below) and $1,640 in borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below); net proceeds of $1,211 from the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock related to the
aforementioned acquisition; and $150 in proceeds from employee exercises of 17.3 million stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $8.70 (not in millions). These items were somewhat offset by $1,723 in payments on debt, mostly
related to $1,640 for the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below), and $161 in dividends paid to shareholders.  In July 2015, through the acquisition of RTI (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above), Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of convertible debt; one tranche was
due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 2019 (principal amount of $403), unless earlier converted or purchased by Arconic at the holders option upon a
fundamental change. Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes in accordance with their terms, holders will receive, at Arconics election, cash, shares of common stock (approximately 14,156,000 shares currently), or a combination of cash
and shares. On the maturity date, each holder of outstanding notes will be entitled to receive on such date $1,000 (not in millions) in cash for each $1,000 (not in millions) in principal amount of notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest
to, but not including, the maturity date.  On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the
Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The proceeds are to be used to provide working capital or for
other general corporate purposes of Arconic. In September 2016, Arconic entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Facility including the replacement of the
existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. The amendment became effective on the separation date of November 1, 2016. The previous financial covenant, based upon
Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was replaced. Arconic will be required to maintain a ratio of Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 5.50 to 1.00
for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, declining to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter.  The
Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconics ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on Arconics ability to consummate a merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconics ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2016, Arconic was in compliance with all such covenants. 
The Credit Agreement matures on July 25, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.
Arconic may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Agreement, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will
pay a fee of 0.30% (based on Arconics long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2016) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility. 
  51 


Table of Contents
The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other
unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on
the credit ratings of Arconics outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.70% and 1.70% per annum, respectively, based on Arconics long-term debt ratings as of
December 31, 2016. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.  The obligation of Arconic to
pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Arconics failure to pay the
principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Arconic in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Arconics breach of any of its covenants
contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic.  There were no amounts outstanding at
December 31, 2016 and 2015 and no amounts were borrowed during 2016, 2015 or 2014 under the Credit Facility In addition to the Credit Facility above, Arconic has a number of other credit facilities that provide a combined borrowing capacity of
$715 as of December 31, 2016, of which $465 is due to expire in 2017 and $250 is due to expire in 2018. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate
purposes. The covenants contained in all these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above).  In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Arconic
borrowed and repaid $1,950, $1,890, and $1,640, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 1.88%,
1.61%, and 1.54%, respectively, and 49 days, 69 days, and 67 days, respectively.  In February 2014, Arconics automatic shelf
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission expired. On July 11, 2014, Arconic filed a new shelf registration statement, which was amended on July 25, 2014 and became effective on July 30, 2014, for up to
$5,000 of securities on an unallocated basis for future issuance. As of December 31, 2016, $2,500 in securities were issued under the new shelf registration statement.  In September 2014, Arconic completed two public securities offerings under its shelf registration statement for (i) $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in
a share of Arconics 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share, and (ii) $1,250 of 5.125% Notes due 2024. The net proceeds of the offerings were used to
finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above). 
Arconics cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and
long-term debt ratings assigned to Arconics debt by the major credit rating agencies.  On March 31, 2016, Moodys Investor
Service (Moodys) affirmed the following ratings for Arconic: long-term debt at Ba1 and short-term debt at Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating-1. Additionally, Moodys changed the current outlook from rating under review to negative. On
June 30, 2016, Moodys maintained the current outlook as negative based on the filing of a Form 10 registration statement related to the planned separation of Arconic. On September 22, 2016, Moodys placed the long-term debt
rating Ba1 as under review for possible downgrade. On November 1, 2016, Moodys downgraded Arconics long-term debt to Ba2 and short-term debt to Speculative Grade Liquidity-2 based upon the completion of the Separation Transaction.
Additionally, Moodys changed the current outlook to stable.  On April 21, 2016, Fitch affirmed the following ratings for Arconic:
long-term debt at BB+ and short-term debt at B. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving. On July 7, 2016, Fitch changed the current outlook from evolving to stable based on the filing of a Form 10 registration
statement related to the planned separation of Arconic.

Table of Contents
On April 29, 2016, Standard and Poors Ratings Service (S&P) affirmed the following ratings
for Arconic: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at A-3. Additionally, S&P maintained the current outlook as stable. On September 19, 2016, S&P affirmed its ratings for Arconic: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at A-3.
Additionally, S&P maintained the current outlook as stable.  Investing Activities 
Cash used for investing activities was $165 in 2016 compared with $1,060 in 2015 and $3,460 in 2014. 
The use of cash in 2016 was mainly due to $1,125 in capital expenditures ($298 Alcoa Corporation), 29% of which related to growth projects, including the
aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, IA plant and a titanium aluminide furnace at the Niles, Ohio facility. This use of cash was primarily offset by $692 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, including
$457 from the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies, $120 in proceeds related to the sale of the Intalco smelter wharf property (Alcoa Corporation), and $102 in proceeds ($99 net of transaction costs) from the sale of the Remmele
Medical business, which was part of Arconics acquisition of RTI in July 2015; and $280 in sales of investments, composed primarily of $145 for an equity interest in a natural pipeline in Australia (Alcoa Corporation) and $130 for fixed income
and equity securities held by Arconics captive insurance company.  The use of cash in 2015 was mainly due to $1,180 in capital
expenditures ($391 Alcoa Corporation) (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $141), 38% of which related to growth projects, including the aerospace expansion at the La Porte, IN plant, the automotive
expansion at the Alcoa, TN plant, the aerospace expansion (very thick plate stretcher) at the Davenport, IA plant, the aerospace expansion (isothermal press) at the Savannah, GA plant (Firth Rixson), and the specialty foil expansion at the
Itapissuma plant in Brazil; $205 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of TITAL (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above); and $134 in additions to investments, including the purchase of $70 in equities and fixed
income securities held by Arconics captive insurance company and equity contributions of $29 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia (Alcoa Corporation). These items were somewhat offset by $302 in cash acquired from RTI
(see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above); $112 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, composed of three land sales in Australia and the United States combined and post-closing adjustments related to an
ownership stake in a smelter (Alcoa Corporation), four rolling mills, and an ownership stake in a bauxite mine/alumina refinery (Alcoa Corporation) divested from December 2014 through March 2015; and $40 in sales of investments, related to the sale
of $21 in equities and fixed income securities held by Arconics captive insurance company and $19 in proceeds from the sale of the remaining portion of an equity investment in a China rolling mill. 
The use of cash in 2014 was principally due to $2,385 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of Firth Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions
in Segment Information above); $1,219 in capital expenditures ($444 for Alcoa Corporation) (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $129), 40% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive
expansions at the Alcoa, TN and Davenport, IA fabrication plants, the aerospace expansion at the La Porte, IN plant, the aluminum-lithium capacity expansion at the Lafayette, IN plant, and the specialty foil expansion at the Itapissuma plant in
Brazil; and $195 in additions to investments, including equity contributions of $120 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia (Alcoa Corporation) and the purchase of $49 in equities and fixed income securities held by
Arconics captive insurance company. These items were slightly offset by $253 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, largely attributable to the sale of an ownership stake in a bauxite mine and refinery in Jamaica (Alcoa
Corporation), an ownership stake in a smelter in the United States (Alcoa Corporation), three rolling mills in Spain and France combined (see Global Rolled Products in Segment Information above), and a rod plant in Canada (Alcoa Corporation); and
$57 in sales of investments, mostly related to $42 in combined proceeds from the sale of a mining interest in Suriname (Alcoa Corporation) and a portion of an equity investment in a China rolling mill. 
Noncash Financing and Investing Activities. On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split (the Reverse Stock
Split). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 
  53 


Table of Contents

approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. This transaction was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as it represents a noncash financing activity.  In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock
consisting of approximately 76 million shares. As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury shares. This transaction was not reflected in the
accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 as it represents a noncash financing activity.  In
July 2015, Arconic purchased all outstanding shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870. As a result, Arconic issued 29 million shares (87 million sharespre-Reverse stock split) of its common stock to
consummate this transaction, which was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash financing activity.  In early 2014, holders of $575 principal amount of Arconics 5.25% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2014 (the 2014 Notes) exercised their option to convert the 2014 Notes into
30 million shares (89 million sharespre-Reverse Stock Splitsee Note A) of Arconic common stock. This transaction was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash financing
activity.  In late 2014, Arconic paid $2,995 (net of cash acquired) to acquire Firth Rixson. A portion of this consideration was paid through
the issuance of 12 million shares (37 million sharespre-Reverse Stock Split) in Arconic common stock valued at $610. The issuance of common stock was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it
represents a noncash investing activity.  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
Contractual Obligations. Arconic is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing
arrangements, and lease agreements. Arconic also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2016, a summary of Arconics outstanding
contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to
provide a basis for comparison to historical information):

Table of Contents
Obligations for Operating Activities  Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from one year to six years. Raw material purchase obligations consist mostly of
aluminum, titanium sponge, and various other metals with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to four years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from
the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.  Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2016 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. The effect of outstanding interest rate
swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, was included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2016, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $200 of debt through 2018. As the
contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table.  Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate
of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. The minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be $310 for 2017, $325 for 2018, $325 for 2019, $425 for 2020, and $350 for 2021. These expected
pension contributions reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006; the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008; the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012; the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014; and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Other
postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $95 annually for years 2017 through 2021 and $83 annually for years 2022 through 2026. Such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, which are
estimated to be approximately $5 annually for years 2017 through 2026. Arconic has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2021 and 2026, respectively. 
Layoff and other restructuring payments to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs, contract termination costs and special layoff
benefit payments.  Deferred revenue arrangements require Arconic to deliver product to certain customers over the specified contract period
(through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract and 2021 for certain aerospace parts contracts). While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the
specified product deliveries could not be made.  Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in
additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2016. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the
Thereafter column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires,
then additional payments will not be necessary.  Obligations for Financing Activities 
Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2042.  Arconic has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including
dividends on preferred stock, Arconic paid $228 in dividends to shareholders during 2016. This amount includes dividends related to a class of preferred stock issued in September 2014 (see Financing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources
above). Because all dividends are subject to approval by Arconics Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. There were $17 of preferred stock dividends approved to be paid on
January 1,

2017; however, Arconic paid the dividends on December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there were 438,519,780 shares of outstanding common stock and 546,024 and 2,500,000 shares of
outstanding Class A and Class B preferred stock, respectively. The annual Class A and Class B preferred stock dividends are at the rate of $3.75 and $26.8750 per share, respectively, and the annual common stock dividend expected to be paid
is $0.24 per share for 2017.  Obligations for Investing Activities  Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2016. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the
projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $650 in 2017. 
Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Arconic
if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In connection with the acquisition of Firth
Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information above), Arconic entered into an earn-out agreement, which states that Arconic will make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through 2020. Based upon the
evaluation of financial and operational forecasts, the expected estimated payment has been reduced. The amounts in the preceding table represent Arconics best estimate of the amount and timing of payments. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  At
December 31, 2016, Arconic has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under
these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2017 and 2026 was $51 at December 31, 2016.  As part of the Separation
Transaction, Arconic was required to provide maximum potential future payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party of $354. These guarantees expire at various times between 2017 and 2024 and relate to project financing
for Alcoa Corporations aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide guarantees up to an estimated present value amount of $1,600 related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation
facilities. Per the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic is only liable for these guaranteed amounts in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment default. In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one year claims purchase agreement with a
bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium related to this claims purchase agreement is being paid by Alcoa Corporation. At December 31,
2016, the combined fair value of the three required guarantees was $35 which was included in Other Noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Arconic was also required to provide guarantees of $50 related to two Alcoa Corporation energy supply contracts. These guarantees expire in March 2017. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide
guarantees of $53 related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities. Notification of a change in guarantor has been made to the appropriate environmental agencies and Alcoa Corporation is required by the end of March 2017 to self-bond
or provide collateral.  Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts and
leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2017 was $212 at December 31, 2016.  As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to retain letters of credit of $62 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers compensation
claims which occurred prior to 
  56 


Table of Contents

November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims and letter of credit fees paid by Arconic are being billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.
Additionally, Arconic was required to provide letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and energy contracts and, as a result, Arconic has $103 of outstanding letters of credit relating to these liabilities. The entire $103 of
outstanding letters of credit were canceled in 2017 when Alcoa Corporation issued its own letters of credit to cover these obligations. 
Arconic also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers compensation, environmental-related
matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2017, was $120 at December 31, 2016.  As part of the Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a
result, Arconic has $22 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic are being billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments,
estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include
accounting for environmental and litigation matters; the testing of goodwill, other intangible assets, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested; pension plans and other
postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.  Management uses historical experience and all available
information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes
that Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. 
A summary of the Companys significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of
this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Companys
operating results and financial condition.  Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as
appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The
liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are
recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their
proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.
 Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to
be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions
of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed 
  57 


Table of Contents

probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then
the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in managements judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable
outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.  Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in
the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may
include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or
a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. 
Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an
operating segment. Arconic has eight reporting units, of which four are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, three are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, and the remaining reporting unit is the
Global Rolled Products segment. More than 70% of Arconics total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Arconic Fastening Systems and Rings (AFSR) ($2,200) and Arconic Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,647) businesses, both of
which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporates goodwill.  In
November 2014, Arconic acquired Firth Rixson (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment Information under Results of Operations above), and, as a result recognized $1,801 in goodwill. This amount was allocated between the AFSR and Arconic
Forgings and Extrusions (AFE) reporting units, both of which are part of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. In March and July 2015, Arconic acquired TITAL and RTI, respectively, (see Engineered Products and Solutions in Segment
Information under Results of Operations above) and recognized $117 and $298, respectively, in goodwill. The goodwill amount related to TITAL was allocated to the APP reporting unit and the amount related to RTI was allocated to Arconic Titanium and
Engineered Products (ATEP), a new Arconic reporting unit that consists solely of the acquired RTI business and is part of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment.  In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more
likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is
then required to perform the existing two-step quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the
two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two-step quantitative
impairment test.  Arconics policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not
subjected directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Generally, management will proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for up to four reporting units (based on facts and circumstances) during each annual review of
goodwill. This policy will result in each of the seven reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the two-step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three-year period.  Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above).
These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on 
  58 


Table of Contents

current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low
weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each
reporting unit.  During the 2016 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for three reporting units, the
Global Rolled Products segment, ATEP, and Building and Construction Systems (within the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment). Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the three
reporting units were less than their carrying values. As such, no further analysis was required.  Under the two-step quantitative impairment
test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units
when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows,
including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are
generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units WACC rate are estimated for each business with the
assistance of valuation experts.  In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value,
additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair
value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of
operations and shareholders equity.  During the 2016 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the two-step
quantitative impairment test for four reporting units as follows: AFSR, APP, and AFE, which are all included in the EPS segment, and Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions
segment. The estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment.  Goodwill
impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Companys reporting units, except for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil (SAE) which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions
segment, and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test.  In 2015, for SAE, the estimated fair value
as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated carrying value of the SAE reporting units goodwill. As a result, management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of the
SAE reporting units goodwill. The results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2015, Arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of $25. The impairment of the
SAE goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the Brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies. As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for
the SAE reporting unit.  Properties, Plants, and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets. Properties, plants, and equipment and Other
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the

  59 


Table of Contents

estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets
(asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using
the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments.
 Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted
valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including
the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair
value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant
assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend
rates, retirement age, and mortality).  The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific
yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds,
which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, consumer products, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash
flows, which have an average duration of 11 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Companys plans obligations multiple times. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, the
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.20%, 4.29%, and 4.00%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately
$210 and either a charge or credit of approximately $6 to after-tax earnings in the following year.  In conjunction with the annual
measurement of the funded status of Arconics pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined
in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology,
the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the spot rate approach).
This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology of $98 ($64 after-tax) in 2016. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change
in an accounting estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each years cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for
certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return
information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective
return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as managements own judgment. 
  60 


Table of Contents
For 2016, 2015, and 2014, management used 7.75%, 7.75%, and 8.00% as its expected long-term rate of return,
which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected
future return developed by asset class. In 2015, the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance. For 2017, management anticipates that 7.75% will be
the expected long-term rate of return.  A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would
impact after-tax earnings by approximately $8 for 2017.  During 2014, an independent U.S. organization that publishes standard mortality rates
based on statistical analysis and studies issued updated mortality tables. The rates within these standard tables are used by actuaries as one of the many assumptions when measuring a companys projected benefit obligation for pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. The funded status of all of Arconics pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of December 31 each calendar year. During the measurement process at the end of 2014, Arconic, with the
assistance of an external actuary, considered the rates in the new mortality tables, along with specific data related to Arconics retiree population, to develop the mortality-related assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation of
various U.S. benefit plans. As a result, Arconic recognized a charge of approximately $100 ($65 after-tax) in other comprehensive loss related to the updated mortality assumptions.  In 2016, a net benefit of $1,601 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the transfer of $2,080 to Alcoa Corporation which was partially offset
by a net charge of $479. The charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2015, a net charge of $10
(after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets, which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 29 basis point increase in the
discount rate. In 2014, a net charge of $69 (after-tax and noncontrolling interest) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to an 80 basis point increase in the discount rate and a change in the mortality assumption (see above),
which was mostly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses.  Stock-based
Compensation. Arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based
on the grant date fair value. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average
risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. 
As part of Arconics stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the
year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $76 ($51 after-tax), $77 ($51 after-tax),
and $70 ($47 after-tax), respectively. Of these amounts, $19, $15, and $11 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. 
Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is
made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable.  Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and
liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconics assets and
liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences,
projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability
within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconics experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence.
Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax
assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards
of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also
re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.  In 2016, Arconic
recognized a $1,267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction, including $925 with respect to Alcoa Corporations net deferred tax assets in the United States, $302 with respect to Arconics
foreign tax credits in the United States, $42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, and $(2) related to the net impact of other smaller items. After weighing all positive and negative evidence, as described above, management
determined that the net deferred tax assets of Alcoa Corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income. As such, a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to
separation.  Upon separation, Arconic retained foreign tax credits in the United States which have a 10-year carryforward period with
expirations ranging from 2017 to 2026 (as of December 31, 2016). Arconic also retained suspended foreign tax credit carryforwards whose expiration period begins when the credits become unsuspended. A valuation allowance of $135 was initially
established in 2013 on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period. An incremental valuation allowance of $134 was
recognized in 2015. At the end of 2015 and 2016, $15 and $128 of foreign tax credits respectively expired resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. As a result of the Separation Transaction, management determined that it was
no longer more likely than not that Arconic would realize the full tax benefit of its foreign tax credit carryforwards based on changes in the availability of foreign sourced taxable income. After consideration of all available evidence including
potential tax planning strategies and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends, an incremental valuation allowance of $302 was recognized in 2016. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount of
the valuation allowance was $427. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. 
In addition, Arconic recognized a $42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets
in Luxembourg. Sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the Separation Transaction. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in
future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.  In 2016, Arconic also
recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in Russia and Canada of $19 and $20 respectively. After weighing all available evidence, management determined that it was more
likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historical cumulative income and projected taxable income.  Arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in Australia of $93 related to the Separation Transaction, in Spain of $163 related to a tax law change and in Luxembourg of $280 related to the
Separation Transaction as well as a

tax law change. These valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction, resulting in no net impact to tax expense. The need
for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and, as a result, the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. 
In 2015, Arconic recognized an additional $141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Iceland and
Suriname. Of this amount, an $85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in Suriname, which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. These deferred tax assets have an expiration
period ranging from 2016 to 2022 (as of December 31, 2015). The remaining $56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in Iceland. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period
ranging from 2017 to 2023. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax
assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business, combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period.  Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are
recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the
related tax benefits are recognized.  Related Party Transactions  On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These
agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement,
Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum,
Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.  Effective
November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, Indiana rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa Corporation upon the completion of the Separation
Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic will provide a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee throughout the expected end date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa
Corporation will supply all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic will process the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenues for the two month period ending December 31,
2016 and accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 were not material to the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Additionally, Arconic buys products from and sells products to various related companies, including Alcoa Corporation, at negotiated prices between the two parties. These transactions, including accounts
payable, were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Arconic for all periods presented.  Recently Adopted

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  Managements Reports to Arconic Shareholders  Managements Report on
Financial Statements and Practices  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
Company) were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts
that are based on managements best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.  Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Companys affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and
reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests
of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.  Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the
criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Based on the assessment, management has concluded that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Arconic Inc.  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related statements of consolidated operations, consolidated comprehensive loss, changes in consolidated equity, and consolidated cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Arconic Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Arconic and subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts)  A. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  Basis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic Inc. and subsidiaries (Arconic or the
Company) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and require management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These may affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  The separation of Alcoa Inc. into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation, became effective on November 1, 2016 (the
Separation Transaction). The financial results of Alcoa Corporation for all periods prior to the Separation Transaction have been retrospectively reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations and, as
such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with Alcoa Corporation in the December 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified as
assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. The cash flows and comprehensive income related to Alcoa Corporation have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows and Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive
Loss, respectively, for all periods presented. See Note C for additional information related to the Separation Transaction and discontinued operations.  Pursuant to the authorization provided at a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders held on October 5, 2016, shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of Arconics outstanding
and authorized shares of common stock (the Reverse Stock Split). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 3 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without
any change in the par value per share. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The Companys common stock began trading on a
reverse stock split-adjusted basis on the NYSE on October 6, 2016.  Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Arconic and companies in which Arconic has a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which Arconic cannot exercise significant influence are accounted for
on the cost method.  Management also evaluates whether an Arconic entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether Arconic is the
primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. Arconic does not have any variable interest entities requiring consolidation.  Related Party Transactions. Arconic buys products from and sells products to various related companies, including Alcoa Corporation, at negotiated prices between the two parties. These
transactions, including accounts payable, were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Arconic for all periods presented (see Note W).  Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.  Inventory Valuation. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost for approximately half of U.S. inventories determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of
other inventories is determined under a combination of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average-cost methods.

Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is recorded principally on the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of structures and machinery and equipment by reporting segment

 Gains or losses from the sale of assets are generally recorded in Other income, net (see policy below for assets
classified as held for sale and discontinued operations). Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Interest related to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs. 
Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such
assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be
recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over
their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and
the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not
amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining
if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input
costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate
the impairment of goodwill.  Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic has eight reporting units, of which four are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, three are included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment,
and the remaining reporting unit is the Global Rolled Products segment. More than 70% of Arconics total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Arconic Fastening Systems and Rings (AFSR) ($2,200) and Arconic Power and
Propulsion (APP) ($1,647) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporates goodwill.  In November 2014, Arconic acquired Firth Rixson (see Note F), and, as a result recognized $1,801 in goodwill. This amount was allocated between the AFSR and Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (AFE) reporting
units, which is part of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. In March and July 2015, Arconic acquired TITAL and RTI, respectively, (see Note F) and recognized $117 and $298, respectively, in goodwill. The goodwill amount related to TITAL
was allocated to the APP reporting unit and the amount related to RTI was allocated to Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (ATEP), a new Arconic reporting unit that consists solely of the acquired RTI business and is part of the Engineered
Products and Solutions segment.  In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform
a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the 
  73 


Table of Contents

existing two-step quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead,
proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the
two-step quantitative impairment test.  Arconics policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for
all reporting units not subjected directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Generally, management will proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for up to four reporting units (based on facts and circumstances)
during each annual review of goodwill. This policy will result in each of the seven reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the two-step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three-year period. 
Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are
identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions.
Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step
quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.  During the 2016 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for three reporting units, the Global Rolled Products segment, ATEP, and Building and Construction Systems
(within the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment). Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the three reporting units were less than their carrying values. As such, no further analysis
was required.  Under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best
indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax
rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and
historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units WACC rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts.  In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying
amount of the reporting units goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value
amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity.  During the 2016 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for four reporting units as follows: AFSR, APP, and AFE, which are all included in the
Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and Arconic Wheel and Transportation Products which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective
carrying value, resulting in no impairment.  Goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the
Companys reporting units, except for the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil (SAE) which is included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an
impairment test.

Table of Contents
In 2015, for SAE, the estimated fair value as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated
carrying value of the SAE reporting units goodwill. As a result, management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of the SAE reporting units goodwill. The results of the
second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2015, Arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of $25. The impairment of the SAE goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn
in the Brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies. As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the SAE reporting unit. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a
straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The following table details the weighted-average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by reporting segment (numbers in years):

 Revenue Recognition. Arconic recognizes revenues when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all
of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product and is based on the applicable shipping terms. The shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (truck, train, or
vessel).  In certain circumstances, Arconic receives advanced payments from its customers for product to be delivered in future periods. These
advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the product is delivered and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred revenue is included in Other current liabilities and
Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Environmental Matters. Expenditures
for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs
are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by
potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason
to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant,
including changes in technology or regulations.  Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when
an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case
strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable,
management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With
respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate
the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in managements judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.

Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of
accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the
future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconics assets and liabilities and are adjusted for
changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than
not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary
differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future
profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconics experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional
positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of
income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined
under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays. 
Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not
threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the
statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable
under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.  Stock-Based Compensation. Arconic recognizes
compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The
fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend
yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.  Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable.
 Foreign Currency. The local currency is the functional currency for Arconics significant operations outside the United States,
except for certain operations in Canada and Russia, where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. The determination of the functional currency for Arconics operations is made based on the appropriate economic and management
indicators.  Acquisitions. Arconics business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in
the Statement of Consolidated Operations from the date of the acquisition.

Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. For those businesses where management has committed
to a plan to divest, each business is valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is
estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of
these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are
made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets
of a business to be divested once they are classified as held for sale. Businesses to be divested are classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as either discontinued operations or held for sale. 
For businesses classified as discontinued operations, the balance sheet amounts and results of operations are reclassified from their historical
presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, respectively, for all periods presented. The gains or losses associated
with these divested businesses are recorded in discontinued operations on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows is not required to be reclassified for discontinued operations for any period. Segment
information does not include the assets or operating results of businesses classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These businesses are expected to be disposed of within one year. 
For businesses classified as held for sale that do not qualify for discontinued operations treatment, the balance sheet and cash flow amounts are
reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale for all periods presented. The results of operations continue to be reported in continuing operations. The gains or losses associated with these
divested businesses are recorded in restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The segment information includes the assets and operating results of businesses classified as held for sale for all periods presented.
 Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance. On January 1, 2016, Arconic adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) to the presentation of extraordinary items. Such items are defined as transactions or events that are both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence, and previously, were required to be presented separately in an entitys
income statement, net of income tax, after income from continuing operations. The changes eliminate the concept of an extraordinary item and, therefore, the presentation of such items is no longer required. Notwithstanding this change, an entity is
still required to present and disclose a transaction or event that is both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence in the notes to the financial statements. The adoption of these changes had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 On January 1, 2016, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB to the analysis an entity must perform to determine whether it should
consolidate certain types of legal entities. These changes (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that
a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party
relationships, and (iv) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule
2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. The adoption of these changes had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 1, 2016, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB to the presentation of debt issuance costs. Previously, such costs were required to be presented as a noncurrent asset in an
entitys balance sheet and amortized into interest expense over the term of the related debt instrument. The changes require that debt issuance costs be presented in an entitys balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value
of the related debt liability. The 
  77 


Table of Contents

amortization of debt issuance costs remains unchanged. The FASB issued an update to these changes based on an announcement of the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This update
provides an exception to the FASB changes allowing debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements to continue to be presented as an asset regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings under such arrangement. This additional
change also was adopted by Arconic on January 1, 2016. This adoption is required on a retrospective basis; therefore, the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet has been updated to conform to the December 31, 2016 presentation.
As a result, $51 of debt issuance costs (previously reported in Other noncurrent assets) were reclassified to the Long-term debt, less amount due within one year line item on the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
For the 2016 annual period, Arconic adopted changes issued by the FASB related to the evaluation of an entitys ability to continue as a going
concern. Previously, under GAAP, continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern was presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entitys liquidation becomes imminent. Even if an entitys liquidation
was not imminent, there may have been conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern. Because there was no guidance in GAAP about managements responsibility to evaluate whether
there was substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related note disclosures, there was diversity in practice whether, when, and how an entity discloses the relevant conditions and events in its
financial statements. As a result, these changes require an entitys management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date that financial statements are issued. Substantial doubt is defined as an indication that it is probable that an entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date
that financial statements are issued. If management has concluded that substantial doubt exists, then the following disclosures should be made in the financial statements: (i) principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt,
(ii) managements evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entitys ability to meet its obligations, (iii) managements plans that alleviated the initial substantial doubt or, if
substantial doubt was not alleviated, managements plans that are intended to at least mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, and (iv) if the latter in (iii) is disclosed, an explicit statement that there is
substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern. The adoption of these changes had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. This guidance will need to be applied by management at the end of each annual
period and interim period therein to determine what, if any, impact there will be on the Consolidated Financial Statements in a given reporting period.  Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. In January 2016, the FASB issued changes to equity investments. These changes require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of
accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable
fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Additionally, the impairment assessment of equity
investments without readily determinable fair values has been simplified by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018. Management has determined that the potential
impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements will not be material.  In February 2016, the FASB issued changes to the
accounting and presentation of leases. These changes require lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is
permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability. Additionally, when measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, optional payments should be included
only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, exercise a purchase option, or not exercise an option to terminate the lease. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2019. Management is
currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued changes
to employee share-based payment accounting. Currently, an entity must determine for each share-based payment award whether the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes
results in either an excess tax benefit or a tax deficiency. 
  78 


Table of Contents

Excess tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in capital; tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or in the income statement.
Excess tax benefits are not recognized until the deduction reduces taxes payable. The changes require all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income
statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in
the current period. Additionally, the presentation of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in the statement of cash flows is changed. Currently, excess tax benefits must be separated from other income tax cash flows and
classified as a financing activity. The changes require excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. Also, the changes require cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for
tax-withholding purposes to be classified as a financing activity. Currently, there is no specific guidance on the classification in the statement of cash flows of cash paid by an employer to the tax authorities when directly withholding shares for
tax-withholding purposes. Additionally, for a share-based award to qualify for equity classification it cannot partially settle in cash in excess of the employers minimum statutory withholding requirements. The changes permit equity
classification of share-based awards for withholdings up to the maximum statutory tax rates in applicable jurisdictions. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2017. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance
will not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued changes eliminating the requirement
for an investor to adjust an equity method investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held as a
result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Additionally, an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting must recognize through earnings the
unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2017. Management has determined that
the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued
changes to derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments. These changes clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require
dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2017. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will
not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In June 2016, the FASB added a new impairment model (known as the
current expected credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. The CECL model applies to most debt
instruments, trade receivables, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and other loan commitments. The CECL model does not have a minimum threshold for recognition of impairment losses and entities will need to measure expected credit
losses on assets that have a low risk of loss. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In August 2016, the FASB issued changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The guidance
identifies eight specific cash flow items and the sections where they must be presented within the statement of cash flows. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018. Management does not expect these changes to have a
material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In October 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting for Intra-Entity
transactions, other than inventory. Under current US GAAP, no immediate tax impact is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of intra-entity transfers of assets. The current standard precludes an entity from
reflecting a tax benefit or expense from an intra-entity asset transfer between entities that file separate tax returns, whether or not such entities are in different tax jurisdictions, until the asset has been sold to a third party or otherwise
recovered. The current standard also prohibits recognition by the buyer of a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference arising from the excess of the buyers tax 
  79 


Table of Contents

basis over the cost to the seller. The changes require the current and deferred income tax consequences of the intra-entity transfer to be recorded when the transaction occurs. The exception
to defer the tax consequences of inventory transactions is maintained. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2017. Management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.  In November 2016, the FASB issued changes to the classification of cash and cash equivalents within the
cash flow statement. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will be included within the cash and cash equivalents line on the cash flow statement and a reconciliation must be prepared to the statement of financial position. Transfers
between restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents will no longer be presented as cash flow activities in the statement of cash flows and material balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents must
disclose information regarding the nature of the restrictions. These changes become effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018. Management has determined that the adoption of these changes will not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.  In July 2015, the FASB issued changes to the subsequent measurement of inventory. Currently, an entity is required to
measure its inventory at the lower of cost or market, whereby market can be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The changes require that inventory be measured at the lower of
cost and net realizable value, thereby eliminating the use of the other two market methodologies. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. These changes do not apply to inventories measured using LIFO (last-in, first-out) or the retail inventory method. Currently, Arconic applies the net realizable value market option to measure non-LIFO inventories at the
lower of cost or market. These changes became effective for Arconic on January 1, 2017. Management has determined that the adoption of these changes will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued changes to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. These changes created a comprehensive framework for all
entities in all industries to apply in the determination of when to recognize revenue, and, therefore, supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition requirements and guidance. This framework is expected to result in less complex guidance in
application while providing a consistent and comparable methodology for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer,
(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s), and (v) recognize revenue when, or as,
the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year, making these changes effective for Arconic on January 1, 2018. The Company has formed a project assessment and adoption team
and is currently reviewing contract terms and assessing the impact of adopting the standard on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

C. Separation Transaction and Discontinued Operations  On November 1, 2016, Arconic completed the Separation Transaction. Alcoa Inc., which was re-named Arconic Inc., continues to own the Global Rolled Products (except for the Warrick, IN rolling
operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia), Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa Corporation includes the Alumina and Primary Metals
segments and the aforementioned Warrick, IN rolling operations and equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were formally part of the Global Rolled Products segment. 
Arconic completed the Separation Transaction by distribution on November 1, 2016 of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to
the Companys shareholders of record (the Distribution) as of the close of business on October 20, 2016 (the Record Date). Arconic retained 19.9% of the Alcoa Corporation common stock (36,311,767 shares). In the
Distribution, each Company shareholder received one share of Alcoa Corporation common stock for every three shares of Arconic common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. Shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Alcoa Corporation common stock.  Arconic has recorded the 19.9% retained interest in Alcoa Corporation common stock as a cost method
investment in Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation in the December 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value was based on the closing stock price of Alcoa Corporation as of December 31, 2016 multiplied by the number of shares
of Alcoa Corporation common stock owned by the Company as of December 31, 2016. The changes in fair value since November 1, 2016 were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties following the
completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Patent,
Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement, Master
Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.  Effective November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, IN rolling mill which became a part of Alcoa
Corporation upon completion of the Separation Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic will provide a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the expected end date of
the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation will supply all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic will process the

raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenues for the two month period ending December 31, 2016 and accounts receivable were not
material to the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the year ended December 31, 2016.  As part of the
Separation Transaction, Arconic was required to provide maximum potential future payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party, guarantees related to two Alcoa Corporation energy supply contracts and certain Alcoa
Corporation environmental liabilities, letters of credit and surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016, and letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment
leases and energy contracts (see Note L).  Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company has recorded a
receivable of $243 due from Alcoa Corporation for a certain asset sale. This amount was included in Other receivables in the December 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The results of operations of Alcoa Corporation are presented as discontinued operations in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as summarized below:

 During 2016 and 2015, Arconic recognized $193 ($158 after-tax) and $24 ($24 after-tax), respectively, in Selling, general
administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for costs related to the Separation Transaction. In addition, Arconic also incurred capital expenditures and debt issuance costs of $110 during 2016 related
to the Separation Transaction. None of the aforementioned costs and expenses related to the Separation Transaction were reclassified into discontinued operations.  On November 1, 2016, management evaluated the net assets of Alcoa Corporation for potential impairment and determined that no impairment charge was required.

 Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified
positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans.   2016 Actions. In 2016, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $155 ($114 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: $57 ($46 after-tax) for costs related to the exit
of certain legacy Firth Rixson operations in the U.K.; $37 ($24 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down a can sheet facility; $20 ($14 after-tax) for costs related to the closures of five facilities, primarily in
the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment and Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including the separation of approximately 280 employees; $53 ($33 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,315
employees (30 in TCS, 1,045 in EPS, 30 in GRP and 210 in Corporate); $11 ($8 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for the sale of Remmele Medical, an RTI subsidiary; $2 ($1 after-tax) for a pension settlement; and
$25 ($12 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods.  In 2016, management made the decision to
exit certain legacy Firth Rixson facilities in the U.K. Costs related to these actions included asset impairments and accelerated depreciation of $51; other exit costs of $4; and $2 for the separation of 60 employees. 
Also in 2016, management approved the shutdown and demolition of the can sheet facility in Tennessee upon completion of the Toll Processing and Services
Agreement with Alcoa Corporation. Costs related to this action included $21 in asset impairments; $9 in other exit costs; and $7 for the separation of 145 employees. The other exit costs of $9 represent $4 in asset retirement obligations and $3 in
environmental remediation, both of which were triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish the can sheet facility in Tennessee, and $2 in other exit costs.  As of December 31, 2016, approximately 880 of the 1,800 employees were separated. The remaining separations for 2016 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2017. In 2016,
cash payments of $16 were made against layoff reserves related to 2016 restructuring programs.  2015 Actions. In 2015, Arconic recorded
Restructuring and other charges of $214 ($192 after-tax), which were comprised of the following components: a $136 ($134 after-tax) net loss related to the March 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in Russia and post-closing adjustments associated
with the December 2014 divestitures of three rolling mills located in Spain and France; $97 ($70 after-tax) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,505 employees (425 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment,
590 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 90 in the Global Rolled Products segment, and 400 in Corporate); an $18 ($13 after-tax) gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in Australia that was permanently closed in
December 2014 (see 2014 Actions below); a net charge of $7 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $8 ($3 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods. 
  85 


Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2016, approximately 1,100 of the 1,240 (previously 1,505) employees were separated.
The total number of employees associated with 2015 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees, who were initially identified for separation, accepting other positions within Arconic and natural attrition. The remaining separations for
2015 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2017. In 2016 and 2015, cash payments of $55 and $18, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2015 restructuring programs. 
2014 Actions. In 2014, Arconic recorded Restructuring and other charges of $314 ($249 after-tax), which were comprised of the following
components: $154 ($107 after-tax) for exit costs related to the decision to permanently shut down and demolish two rolling mills (see below); a $111 ($112 after-tax) net loss primarily for the divestitures of three rolling mills in Spain and France
(see Note F); $49 ($28 after-tax) for other layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,035 employees (470 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 410 in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment, 45 in the Global
Rolled Products segment, and 110 in Corporate); a net charge of $10 ($7 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $10 ($5 after-tax) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods. 
In early 2014, management approved the permanent shutdown of Arconics two rolling mills in Australia, Point Henry and Yennora. This decision was
made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both Australia and Asia. The two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200,000 metric-tons-per-year and were closed by the end of 2014. Costs related to the shutdown of
the two rolling mills included $56 for the separation of approximately 470 employees; accelerated depreciation of $58 as the rolling mills continued to operate during 2014; asset impairments of $7 representing the write-off of the remaining book
value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $33 in other exit costs. Additionally, in 2014, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value, resulting in a charge of
$13 ($9 after-tax), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs of $33 represent $18 in environmental remediation and $8 in asset retirement obligations, both of which were
triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in Australia, and $7 in other related costs, including supplier and customer contract-related costs. Demolition and remediation activities related to the
two rolling mills began in mid-2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018.  As of December 31, 2016, the separations
associated with 2014 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, cash payments of $3, $27, and $54, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2014 restructuring programs. 
Arconic does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating such charges to
segment results would have been as follows:

Other includes reversals of previously recorded restructuring charges and the effects of foreign currency translation. In 2016 and 2014, Other for other exit costs also
included a reclassification of $8 and $8, respectively, in asset retirement and $2 and $18, respectively, in environmental obligations, as these liabilities were included in Arconics separate reserves for asset retirement obligations and
environmental remediation. In 2015, Other for other exit costs included a reclassification of $5 for certain obligations included in Arconics separate reserves for warranties, lease terminations and tax indemnities. In 2016, Other for other
exit costs also included a reclassification of $4 in legal obligations, as these liabilities were included in Arconics separate reserves for legal costs.

As of December 31, 2016, the amount reflected in Corporate is allocated to Arconics three reportable segments ($60 to Global Rolled Products, $253 to
Engineered Products and Solutions, and $18 to Transportation and Construction Solutions) for purposes of impairment testing (see Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets policy in Note A). This goodwill is reflected in Corporate for segment reporting
purposes because it is not included in managements assessment of performance by the three reportable segments.  In 2015,
Arconic recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $25 related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil, included in the Transportation and Construction Solutions segment (see Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets policy in Note A).  Other intangible assets, which are included in Other noncurrent assets on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheet, were as follows:

 Computer software consists primarily of software costs associated with an enterprise business solution (EBS) within
Arconic to drive common systems among all businesses.  Amortization expense related to the intangible assets in the tables above for the years
ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $65, $67, and $55, respectively, and is expected to be in the range of approximately $56 to $64 annually from 2017 to 2021.  F. Acquisitions and Divestitures  Pro forma results of the
Company, assuming all acquisitions described below were made at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented, would not have been materially different from the results reported.  2016 Divestitures. In April 2016, Arconic completed the sale of the Remmele Medical business to LISI MEDICAL for $102 in cash ($99 net of transaction costs), which was included in Proceeds from the
sale of assets and businesses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This business, which was part of the RTI International Metals Inc. (RTI) acquisition (see below), manufactures precision-machined metal products for customers in
the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets. Since this transaction occurred within a year of the completion of the RTI acquisition, no gain was recorded on this transaction as the excess of the proceeds over the carrying
value of the net assets of this business was reflected as a purchase price adjustment (decrease to goodwill of $44) to the final allocation of the purchase price related to Arconics acquisition of RTI. While owned by Arconic, the operating
results and assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. This business generated sales of approximately $20 from January 1, 2016 through the divestiture date, April 29, 2016, and,
at the time of the divestiture, had approximately 330 employees. This transaction is no longer subject to post-closing adjustments.  2015
Acquisitions. In March 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of an aerospace structural castings company, TITAL, for $204 (188) in cash (an additional $1 (1) was paid in September 2015 to settle working capital in
accordance with the purchase agreement). TITAL, a privately held company with approximately 650 employees based in Germany, produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense markets. The purpose of this
acquisition is to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, establish titanium-casting capabilities in Europe, and expand existing aluminum casting capacity. The assets, including the associated goodwill, and
liabilities of this business were included within Arconics Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, goodwill of $118 was recorded for this transaction.
In the first quarter of 2016, the allocation of the purchase price was finalized, based, in part, on the completion of a third-party valuation of certain assets acquired, resulting in a $1 reduction of the initial goodwill amount. None of the $117
in goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes and no other intangible assets were identified. This transaction is no longer subject to post-closing adjustments.  In July 2015, Arconic completed the acquisition of RTI, a U.S. company that was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RTI. Arconic purchased all outstanding
shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870 (based on the $9.96 per share July 23, 2015 closing price of Arconics 
  89 


Table of Contents

common stock). Each issued and outstanding share of RTI common stock prior to the completion of the transaction was converted into the right to receive 2.8315 shares of Arconic common stock. In
total, Arconic issued 29,132,471 shares (87,397,414 shares pre-reverse stock split  see Note A and Note P) of its common stock to consummate this transaction, which was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as
it represents a noncash financing activity. The exchange ratio was the quotient of a $41 per RTI common share acquisition price and the $14.48 per share March 6, 2015 closing price of Arconics common stock. In addition to the transaction
price, Arconic also paid $25 ($19 after-tax) in professional fees and costs related to this acquisition. This amount was recorded in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations.
 RTI is a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical
device end markets. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand Arconics range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials, primarily related to the aerospace end market. In 2014, RTI generated net sales of $794 and had
approximately 2,600 employees. The operating results and assets and liabilities of RTI were included within Arconics Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Third-party sales and after-tax operating income
(Arconics primary segment performance measure  see Note O) of RTI from the acquisition date through December 31, 2015 were $309 and less than $(1), respectively. During the third quarter of 2016, the final purchase price allocation
was completed.  The following table represents the final allocation of the purchase price by major asset acquired and liability assumed, as
well as the amount of goodwill recognized:

 As reflected in the table above, Arconic recognized goodwill of $298, which represents the earnings growth potential of
RTI, Arconics ability to expand its titanium capabilities in the aerospace market, and expected synergies from combining the operations of the two companies. This goodwill was allocated to a new Arconic reporting unit associated with the
Engineered Products and Solutions segment, Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products, which consists solely of the acquired RTI business. None of this goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. 
The other noncurrent assets in the table above primarily represent intangible assets. These intangible assets consist mainly of customer relationships
which are being amortized over a period of 20 years.  As part of this acquisition, Arconic assumed the obligation to repay two tranches of
convertible debt; one tranche was due and settled in cash on December 1, 2015 (principal amount of $115) and the other tranche is due on October 15, 
  90

2019 (principal amount of $403). Upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes in accordance with their terms, holders will receive, at Arconics election, cash, shares of common stock
(approximately 14,156,000 shares currently, which gives the effect to the Reverse Stock Split (See Note A) and the Distribution of Alcoa Corporation), or a combination of cash and shares. This cash conversion feature requires the convertible notes
to be bifurcated into a liability component and an equity component. The fair value of the liability component was determined by calculating the net present value of the cash flows of the convertible notes using the interest rate of a similar
instrument without a conversion feature. The fair value of the equity component is the difference between the fair value of the entire instrument on the date of acquisition and the fair value of the liability and is included as Additional capital on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  2015 Divestitures. In 2015, Arconic completed the divestiture of an operation in Russia
(see below) and had post-closing adjustments, as provided for in the respective purchase agreements, related to the divestiture completed in December 2014 (see 2014 Divestitures below). The divestiture and post-closing adjustments combined resulted
in net cash paid of $11 and a net loss of $137, which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges (see Note D) on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. These two divestitures are no longer subject to post-closing adjustments.
 In March 2015, Arconic completed the sale of a rolling mill located in Belaya Kalitva, Russia to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stupino
Titanium Company. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mill generated sales of approximately $130 in 2014 and, at the time of
divestiture, had approximately 1,870 employees.  2014 Acquisitions. In June 2014, Arconic signed a purchase agreement to acquire an
aerospace jet engine components company, Firth Rixson, from Oak Hill Capital Partners for $2,850. The purchase price was composed of $2,350 in cash and $500 of Arconic common stock. The common stock component was equivalent to 12,174,337 shares
(36,523,010 shares pre-reverse stock split  see Note A and Note P) at a per share price of $41.07 ($13.69 per share pre-reverse stock split), as determined in the agreement. In conjunction with the purchase agreement, Arconic also entered into
an earn-out agreement, which states that Arconic will make earn-out payments up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 through December 31, 2020 upon certain conditions (see below for additional information). On November 19, 2014, after
satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory approvals, Arconic completed the acquisition of Firth Rixson for $2,995. The purchase price was composed of $2,385 in cash (net of cash acquired) and $610 of Arconic
common stock. The cash portion of the transaction price increased by $35 due to working capital and other adjustments based on the provisions of the purchase agreement. The common stock portion of the transaction price was based on the closing
market price of $50.07 per share ($16.69 per share pre-reverse stock split) of Arconics common stock on the acquisition date.  In
addition to the transaction price, Arconic also paid $42 ($34 after-tax) in professional fees and costs related to this acquisition. This amount was recorded in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the accompanying Statement of
Consolidated Operations. Additionally, Arconic recorded $13 ($8 after-tax) in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations for costs associated with the execution (in June 2014) and termination (in September 2014) of a
$2,500 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility. This facility was entered into for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the cash consideration for this acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.
However, in September 2014, the facility was no longer necessary as Arconic completed the issuance of $2,500 in debt and equity (see Note P) instruments to finance the acquisition.  Firth Rixson manufactures rings, forgings, and metal products for the aerospace end market, as well as other markets requiring highly engineered material applications. At acquisition, this business had 13
operating facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia employing approximately 2,400 people combined. The purpose of this acquisition was to strengthen Arconics aerospace business and position the Company to capture
additional aerospace growth with a broader range of high-growth, value-add jet engine components. The operating results and assets and liabilities of Firth Rixson were included within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment since the date of
acquisition. Third-party sales and after-tax operating income (Arconics primary segment performance measuresee Note O) of Firth Rixson from the acquisition date through December 31, 2014 were $81 and $(12), respectively.

 As reflected in the table above, Arconic recognized goodwill of $1,801, which represents the earnings growth potential of
Firth Rixson and expected synergies from combining the operations of the two companies. The goodwill was allocated to two of Arconics reporting units associated with the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, Arconic Fastening Systems and
Rings ($1,117) and Arconic Forgings and Extrusions ($684), on a relative fair value basis. None of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.  The other noncurrent assets in the table above represent intangible assets, which were included in the other intangibles class (see Note E). These intangible assets consist primarily of customer
relationships and contracts, backlog, qualifications, and technology, and have a weighted-average amortization period of 35 years.  The
contingent consideration liability presented in the table above represents the net present value of the potential earn-out of $150 (Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy  see Note V). This earn-out is contingent on the Firth Rixson forging
business in Savannah, Georgia achieving certain identified financial targets through December 31, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2016, management determined that payment of the maximum amount was not probable based on the forecasted
financial performance of this location. Therefore, the fair value of this liability was reduced by $56 with a corresponding credit to Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. It is estimated that the earn-out will
be paid in 2019 through 2020.  In August 2014, Arconic completed the acquisition of the 30% outstanding noncontrolling interest in the
aluminum brazing sheet venture in Kunshan City, China from Shanxi Yuncheng Engraving Group for $28.  2014 Divestitures. In 2014,
Arconic completed the sale of three rolling mills located in Spain (Alicante and Amorebieta) and France (Castelsarrasin) to a subsidiary of Atlas Holdings LLC. While owned by Arconic, the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling
mills were included in the Global Rolled Products segment. The rolling mills combined generated sales of approximately $500 in 2013 and, at the time of divestiture, had approximately 750 employees. This transaction yielded net cash proceeds of $24
and resulted in a net loss of $116, which was recorded in Restructuring and other charges (see Note D) on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. This transaction was subject to certain post-closing adjustments as defined in the
purchase agreement as of December 31, 2014 (see 2015 Divestitures above).

 At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of inventories valued on a LIFO basis was $947 and $1,009,
respectively. If valued on an average-cost basis, total inventories would have been $371 and $387 higher at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, reductions in LIFO inventory quantities caused partial liquidations of
the lower cost LIFO inventory base. These liquidations resulted in the recognition of immaterial income amounts in both 2016 and 2015, respectively.  H. Properties, Plants, and Equipment, Net

Investments. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Investments were composed of exchange-traded
fixed income and equity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value (see Note V) with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income. Unrealized and realized gains and losses related to
these securities were immaterial in 2016, 2015, and 2014.  During 2016, Arconic sold various fixed income and equity securities held by its
captive insurance company for $130, which is included in Sales of investments on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, and recorded a loss of $3 ($2 after-tax) in Other income, net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated
Operations.  Cash surrender value of life insurance. In the first quarter of 2016, Arconic received $234 in proceeds from the
redemption of certain company-owned life insurance policies. In the second quarter of 2016, Arconic liquidated additional company-owned life insurance policies for $223 in cash. Both of these amounts were included in Proceeds from the sale of assets
and businesses on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. As the cash received was equivalent to the cash surrender value of these policies, no gain or loss was recognized on the sales of these policies.

transaction was completed on December 30, 2016.  Credit Facilities. On July 25, 2014, Arconic entered into a Five-Year
Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein which provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The proceeds are to be used to
provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Arconic. In September 2016, Arconic entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to permit the Separation Transaction and to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement
including the replacement of the existing financial covenant with a leverage ratio and reduction of total commitments available from $4,000 to $3,000. The amendment became effective on the separation date of November 1, 2016. The previous
financial covenant, based upon Consolidated Net Worth (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was replaced. Arconic will be required to maintain a ratio of Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) of 5.50 to 1.00 for the period of the four fiscal quarters most recently ended, declining to 3.50 to 1.00 on December 31, 2019 and thereafter.  The Credit Agreement includes additional covenants, including, among others, (a) limitations on Arconics ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (b) limitations on
Arconics ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (c) limitations on Arconics ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2016, Arconic was in
compliance with all such covenants.  The Credit Facility matures on July 25, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance
with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Arconic may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the
provisions of the Credit Agreement, Arconic will pay a fee up to 0.30% (based on Arconics long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2016) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility. 
The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of
Arconic. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Arconics
outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.70% and 1.70% per annum, respectively, based on Arconics long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2016. Loans may be
prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.  The obligation of Arconic to pay amounts outstanding under the
Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Arconics failure to pay the principal of, or interest on,
borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Arconic in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Arconics breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement,
and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Arconic.  There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and no amounts
were borrowed during 2016, 2015 or 2014 under the Credit Facility. In addition to the Credit Facility above, Arconic has a number of other credit facilities that provide a combined borrowing capacity of $715 as of December 31, 2016, of which
$465 is due to expire in 2017 and $250 is due to expire in 2018. The purpose of any borrowings under these credit arrangements is to provide for working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The covenants contained in all
these arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above).  In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Arconic borrowed and repaid $1,950, $1,890, and
$1,640, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 1.88%, 1.61%, and 1.54%, respectively, and 49
days, 69 days, and 67 days, respectively.

Table of Contents
Short-Term Borrowings. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Short-term borrowings were $36 and $38,
respectively. These amounts included $31 and $32 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to accounts payable settlement arrangements with certain vendors and third-party intermediaries. These arrangements provide that, at the
vendors request, the third-party intermediary advances the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropriate discount, before the scheduled payment date and Arconic makes payment to the third-party intermediary on the date
stipulated in accordance with the commercial terms negotiated with its vendors. Arconic records imputed interest related to these arrangements in Interest expense on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. 
Commercial Paper. Arconic had no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2016 and 2015. In 2016 and 2015, the average outstanding
commercial paper was $127 and $198, respectively. Commercial paper matures at various times within one year and had an annual weighted average interest rate of 1.05%, 0.6%, and 0.6% during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

 L. Contingencies and Commitments 
Contingencies  Environmental
Matters. Arconic participates in environmental assessments and cleanups at more than 100 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and
waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) sites.  A liability is
recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial
actions and related costs. The liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, and technological changes, among others. 
Arconics remediation reserve balance was $308 and $306 at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (of which $48 and $18 was classified as
a current liability), respectively, and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. In 2016, the remediation reserve was increased by $14 due to a net charge
associated with a number of sites and was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. The change in the reserve also reflects a decrease of $2 due to the effects of foreign currency translation and an
increase of $3 related to the acquisition of RTI (see Note F). Payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were $13 in 2016 and include expenditures currently mandated, as well as those not required by any regulatory
authority or third party.  Included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental
programs. These costs are estimated to be approximately 1% or less of cost of goods sold.  The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes
provisions for the assignment or allocation of environmental liabilities between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation including certain remediation obligations associated with 
  96 


Table of Contents

environmental matters. In general, the respective parties will be responsible for the environmental matters associated with their operations, and with the properties and other assets assigned to
each. The only material and reportable matter assigned to Arconic concerns the Grasse River at Arconics Massena West location, the status of which is as follows:  Massena West, NYArconic has an ongoing remediation project related to Grasse River, which is adjacent to Arconics Massena plant site. Many years ago, it was determined that sediments
and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The project, which was selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a Record of Decision (ROD) issued in April 2013, is aimed at capping PCB
contaminated sediments with concentration in excess of one part per million in the main channel of the river and dredging PCB contaminated sediments in the near-shore areas where total PCBs exceed one part per million. At December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the reserve balance associated with this matter was $228 and $234, respectively. Arconic is in the planning and design phase, which is expected to be completed in 2017. Following that, the actual remediation fieldwork is
expected to commence and take approximately four years. The majority of the project funding is expected to be spent between 2017 and 2021. 
Additionally, the Separation and Distribution Agreement lists environmental matters and sites where both parties, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, share
the liability. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for the allocation of responsibility between the two companies as well as identifies the lead party responsible for overall management of the matter. One such site
previously reported on was Fusina, Italy. The share for this site allocated to Arconic is not material, and therefore, Arconic will no longer report on this matter unless and until some event in the future causes this to become material and
reportable.  Lastly, Arconic previously reported on other environmental matters associated with East St. Louis, IL, Sherwin, TX, Baie Comeau,
Quebec, Canada and Mosjoen, Norway. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the legal entities named as parties to these matters are now affiliated with Alcoa Corporation and/or Alcoa Corporation has agreed to take full responsibility for
these locations and has agreed to indemnify Arconic for any future liability associated with these locations, including the need for any future environmental remediation. Therefore, Arconic will also no longer report on these matters unless and
until some event in the future causes any of them to become material and reportable.  Tax. Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (see
Note C) entered into between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction, Arconic shares responsibility with Alcoa Corporation, and Alcoa Corporation has agreed to partially indemnify Arconic with respect to the
following matter.  As previously reported, in September 2010, following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years,
an assessment was received as a result of Spains tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a Spanish consolidated tax group owned by the Company. An appeal of this assessment in Spains Central Tax Administrative
Court by the Company was denied in October 2013. In December 2013, the Company filed an appeal of the assessment in Spains National Court.  Additionally, following a corporate income tax audit of the same Spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years, Spains tax authorities issued an assessment in July 2013 similarly disallowing
certain interest deductions. In August 2013, Arconic filed an appeal of this second assessment in Spains Central Tax Administrative Court, which was denied in January 2015. Arconic filed another appeal of this second assessment in Spains
National Court in March 2015.  The combined assessments (remeasured for a tax rate change enacted in November 2014) total $258 (246). On
January 16, 2017, Spains National Court issued a decision in favor of the Company related to the assessment received in September 2010. It is not yet known if Spains tax authorities will appeal this decision. Spains National
Court has not yet rendered a decision related to the assessment received in July 2013.  The Company believes it has meritorious arguments to
support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through Spains court system. However, in the event the Company is unsuccessful, a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available
to the Spanish consolidated tax group, which 
  97

would be shared between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreement related to the Separation Transaction. Additionally, it is possible that the Company may receive
similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2009. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter.  Other. In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Arconic, including those pertaining to
environmental, product liability, safety and health, and tax matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist.
Therefore, it is possible that the Companys liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the
disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company.  Commitments  Purchase Obligations. Arconic has entered into purchase
commitments for raw materials, energy and other goods and services, which total $490 in 2017, $90 in 2018, $73 in 2019, $64 in 2020, $2 in 2021, and $5 thereafter.  Operating Leases. Certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment are under operating lease agreements. Total expense for all leases was $110 in 2016, $112 in 2015,
and $112 in 2014. Under long-term operating leases, minimum annual rentals are $115 in 2017, $96 in 2018, $75 in 2019, $54 in 2020, $38 in 2021, and $116 thereafter.  Guarantees. At December 31, 2016, Arconic has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and
customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2017 and 2026 was $51 at December 31, 2016.  Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide maximum potential future payment guarantees for Alcoa Corporation issued on behalf of a third party of $354. These
guarantees expire at various times between 2017 and 2024 and relate to project financing for Alcoa Corporations aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide guarantees up to an estimated present value amount
of $1,600 related to two long-term supply agreements for energy for Alcoa Corporation facilities. Per the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic is only liable for these guaranteed amounts in the event of an Alcoa Corporation payment
default. In December 2016, Arconic entered into a one year claims purchase agreement with a bank covering claims up to $245 related to the Saudi Arabian joint venture and two long-term energy supply agreements. The majority of the premium related to
this claims purchase agreement is being paid by Alcoa Corporation. At December 31, 2016, the combined fair value of the three required guarantees was $35 which was included in Other Noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Arconic was also required to provide guarantees of $50 related to two Alcoa Corporation energy
supply contracts. These guarantees expire in March 2017. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide guarantees of $53 related to certain Alcoa Corporation environmental liabilities. Notification of a change in guarantor has been made to the
appropriate environmental agencies and Alcoa Corporation is required by the end of March 2017 to self-bond or provide collateral.  Letters
of Credit. Arconic has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at
various dates, mostly in 2017 was $212 at December 31, 2016.  Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required
to retain letters of credit of $62 that had previously been provided related to both Arconic and Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016. Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims
and letter of credit fees paid by 
  98 


Table of Contents

Arconic are being billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation. Additionally, Arconic was required to provide letters of credit for certain Alcoa Corporation equipment leases and
energy contracts and, as a result, Arconic has $103 of outstanding letters of credit relating to these liabilities. The entire $103 of outstanding letters of credit were canceled in 2017 when Alcoa Corporation issued its own letters of credit to
cover these obligations.  Surety Bonds. Arconic has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance,
workers compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2017, was $120 at December 31, 2016. 
Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Arconic was required to provide surety bonds related to Alcoa Corporation workers
compensation claims which occurred prior to November 1, 2016 and, as a result, Arconic has $22 in outstanding surety bonds relating to these liabilities. Alcoa Corporation workers compensation claims and surety bond fees paid by Arconic
are being billed to and are being fully reimbursed by Alcoa Corporation.  M. Other Income, Net

Noncash Financing and Investing Activities. On October 5, 2016, Arconic completed a 1-for-3
Reverse Stock Split (see Note A). The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to approximately 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00 per
share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. This transaction was not reflected on the Statement of
Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 as it represents a noncash financing activity.  In August 2016, Arconic
retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of approximately 76 million shares (see Note P). As a result, Common stock and Additional capital were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the retirement of the treasury
shares. This transaction was not reflected on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 as it represents a noncash financing activity.  In July 2015, Arconic purchased all outstanding shares of RTI common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $870 (see Note F). As a result, Arconic issued 29 million shares (87 million
sharespre-Reverse Stock Splitsee Note A and Note P) of its common stock to consummate this transaction, which was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash financing activity.
 In early 2014, holders of $575 principal amount of Arconics 5.25% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2014 (the 2014
Notes) exercised their option to convert the 2014 Notes into 30 million shares (89 million sharespre-Reverse Stock Splitsee Note A and Note P) of Arconic common stock. This transaction was not reflected in the
accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash financing activity.  In late 2014, Arconic paid $2,995 (net of
cash acquired) to acquire Firth Rixson (see Note F). A portion of this consideration was paid through the issuance of 12 million shares (37 million sharespre-Reverse Stock Splitsee Note A and Note P) in Arconic common stock
valued at $610. The issuance of common stock was not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash investing activity.  O. Segment and Geographic Area Information  Arconic is a
producer of products including precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Arconics products are used worldwide in transportation (including aerospace, automotive, truck, trailer, rail, and shipping), packaging, building and
construction, oil and gas, defense, and industrial applications. Arconics segments are organized by product on a worldwide basis. Segment performance under Arconics management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors;
however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; metal price lag (the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold
differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segmentgenerally when the price of metal increases, metal lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases, metal lag is unfavorable); interest expense;
noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, corporate research and development expenses, along with depreciation and
amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, and other
nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment ATOI. Segment assets exclude, among others, cash and cash equivalents; deferred income taxes; goodwill not allocated to businesses for
segment reporting purposes; corporate fixed assets; and LIFO reserves.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note A). Transactions among segments are established based on negotiation among the parties. Differences between segment totals and Arconics consolidated totals for line items
not reconciled are in Corporate.

Table of Contents
Arconics operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments as follows: 
Global Rolled Products. This segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. This segment includes sheet and plate sold
directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer
durables) end markets. A small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small
number of customers.  Engineered Products and Solutions. This segment produces products that are used mostly in the aerospace
(commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and power generation end markets. Such products include fastening systems (titanium, steel, and nickel superalloys) and seamless rolled rings (mostly nickel superalloys); investment castings
(nickel superalloys, titanium, and aluminum), including airfoils and forged jet engine components (e.g., jet engine disks); and extruded, machined and formed aircraft parts (titanium and aluminum), all of which are sold directly to customers and
through distributors. More than 75% of the third-party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market. A small part of this segment also produces various forged, extruded, and machined metal products (titanium, aluminum and steel) for the
oil and gas, industrial products, automotive, and land and sea defense end markets. Seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the European summer slowdown across all end markets. 
Transportation and Construction Solutions. This segment produces products that are used mostly in the nonresidential building and construction and
commercial transportation end markets. Such products include integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels, which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. A small part
of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market.

 P. Preferred and Common Stock  Preferred Stock. Arconic has two classes of preferred stock: Class A Preferred Stock and Class B Serial Preferred Stock. Class A Preferred Stock has 660,000 shares authorized at a par
value of $100 per share with an annual $3.75 
  104

cumulative dividend preference per share. There were 546,024 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Class B Serial Preferred Stock has 10 million shares authorized at
a par value of $1 per share. There were 2.5 million of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 (see below).  In
September 2014, Arconic completed a public offering under its shelf registration statement for $1,250 of 25 million depositary shares, each of which represents a 1/10th interest in a share of Arconics 5.375% Class B Mandatory Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1 per share, liquidation preference $500 per share (the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock). The 25 million depositary shares are equivalent to 2.5 million shares of Mandatory
Convertible Preferred Stock. Each depositary share entitles the holder, through the depositary, to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of a share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend,
liquidation, and voting rights, subject to terms of the deposit agreement. Arconic received $1,213 in net proceeds from the public offering reflecting an underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used, together with the net proceeds of issued
debt, to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of Firth Rixson. The underwriting discount was recorded as a decrease to Additional capital. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock constitutes a series of Arconics Class B Serial
Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to Arconics common stock and junior to Arconics Class A Preferred Stock and existing and future indebtedness. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative in nature and
are paid at the rate of $26.8750 per annum per share, which commenced January 1, 2015 (paid on December 30, 2014). Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights. 
On the mandatory conversion date, October 1, 2017, all outstanding shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into
shares of Arconics common stock. As a result of the Separation Transaction and the 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split (see Note A), as defined in the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the conversion rate was adjusted and each share
of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is now convertible into not more than 15.6981 shares of common stock and not less than 13.0817 shares of common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments as described in the terms of the
Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. At any time prior to October 1, 2017, a holder may elect to convert shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one share of Mandatory Convertible
Preferred Stock), at the minimum conversion rate of 13.0817 shares of common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments as described in the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Arconic does not have the right to
redeem the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.  If Arconic undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the terms of the Mandatory
Convertible Preferred Stock, holders may elect to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event less than one share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock), into shares of Arconics common stock.
Holders who elect to convert will also receive any accumulated and unpaid dividends and a Fundamental Change Dividend Make-whole Amount (as defined in the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock) equal to the present value of all
remaining dividend payments on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.  Common Stock. As discussed in Note A, Arconic completed a
1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split on October 5, 2016. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 1.3 billion shares to 0.4 billion shares. The par value of the common stock remained at $1.00
per share. Accordingly, Common stock and Additional capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 reflect a decrease and increase of $877, respectively. The number of authorized shares of common stock was also
decreased from 1.8 billion shares to 0.6 billion shares.  In August 2016, Arconic retired its outstanding treasury stock consisting of
approximately 25 million shares (76 million shares pre-reverse stock split). As a result, Common stock and Additional capital in the accompanying 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet were decreased by $76 and $2,563, respectively, to reflect the
retirement of the treasury shares.

 Stock-based Compensation  Arconic has a stock-based compensation plan under which stock options and stock awards are granted in January each year to eligible employees. Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their
award in the form of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Stock options are granted at the closing market price of Arconics common stock on
the date of grant and vest over a three-year service period (1/3 each year) with a ten-year contractual term. Restricted stock unit awards also vest over a three-year service period from the date of grant and certain of these awards also include
performance conditions. For the majority of performance stock awards issued in 2016, 2015, and 2014, the final number of shares earned will be based on Arconics achievement of sales and profitability targets over the respective three-year
performance periods. One-third of the award will be earned each year based on the performance against the pre-established targets for that year. The performance stock awards earned over the three-year period vest at the end of the third year.
 In 2016, 2015, and 2014, Arconic recognized stock-based compensation expense of $76 ($51 after-tax), $77 ($51 after-tax), and $70 ($47
after-tax), respectively. For each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 80% of the stock-based compensation expense recognized related to restricted stock unit awards and no stock-based compensation expense was capitalized in any of those years.
At December 31, 2016, there was $45 (pretax) of unrecognized compensation 
  106



Table of Contents

expense related to non-vested stock option grants and non-vested restricted stock unit award grants. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. As part
of Arconics stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each
year for these retirement-eligible employees. Of the total pretax compensation expense recognized in 2016, 2015, and 2014, $19, $15, and $11, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. 
Stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of the applicable equity grant. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value
was equivalent to the closing market price of Arconics common stock on the date of grant. For stock options, the fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model, which generated a result of $4.78, $10.07, and $6.40
per option in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The lattice-pricing model uses a number of assumptions to estimate the fair value of a stock option, including a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, exercise behavior, and
contractual life. The following paragraph describes in detail the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2016 (the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in 2015 and 2014 were not
materially different, except as noted below).  The risk-free interest rate (2.06%) was based on a yield curve of interest rates at the
time of the grant based on the contractual life of the option. The dividend yield (1.1%) was based on a one-year average. Volatility (44.5% for 2016, 36.5% for 2015, and 35.0% in 2014) was based on historical and implied volatilities over the
term of the option. Arconic utilized historical option forfeiture data to estimate annual pre- and post-vesting forfeitures (7%). Exercise behavior (60%) was based on a weighted average exercise ratio (exercise patterns for grants issued over
the number of years in the contractual option term) of an options intrinsic value resulting from historical employee exercise behavior. Based upon the other assumptions used in the determination of the fair value, the life of an option (5.7
years) was an output of the lattice-pricing model. The activity for stock options and stock awards during 2016 was as follows (options and awards in millions):

(A) 
 The number of stock options, stock awards and the weighted average exercise price has been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (see Note A).



(B) 
 As a result of the Separation Transaction, all stock options and stock awards relating to Alcoa Corporation employees were canceled.



(C) 
 As a result of the Separation Transaction, all stock options and stock awards relating to Arconic employees were adjusted to reflect the Separation
Transaction. 


(D) 
 Both the effect of the Reverse Stock Split and the effect of the Separation Transaction were considered modifications of the original stock options and
awards and the modifications were designed such that the intrinsic values of the stock option or stock award were the same both previous to and after the adjustments.  As of December 31, 2016, the number of stock options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.99 years and a total intrinsic value of $10. Additionally, 8.9 million of
the stock options outstanding were fully

Table of Contents

vested and exercisable and had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.75 years, a weighted average exercise price of $26.23, and a total intrinsic value of $0.2 as of
December 31, 2016. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, the cash received from stock option exercises was $4, $25, and $150 and the total tax benefit realized from these exercises was $0, $6, and $28, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock
options exercised during 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $1, $19, and $84, respectively.  Q. Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are computed by dividing earnings, after the deduction of preferred stock dividends declared by the average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding.  The number of shares and per share amounts for all periods presented below have been updated to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (see Note A). The information used to compute basic and diluted EPS
attributable to Arconic common shareholders was as follows (shares in millions):

 Calculated from the Statement of Consolidated Operations as Income (loss) from discontinued operations after income taxes less Net income (loss) from
discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests.  In 2016, basic average shares outstanding and diluted
average shares outstanding were the same because the effect of potential shares of common stock was anti-dilutive as Arconic generated a net loss. As a result, 39 million share equivalents related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock,
14 million share equivalents related to convertible notes, 13 million stock options, and 8 million stock awards were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. Had Arconic generated sufficient net income in 2016, 28 million,
10 million, 4 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options, respectively, would have been included in diluted average
shares outstanding.  In 2015, basic average shares outstanding and diluted average shares outstanding were the same because the effect of
potential shares of common stock was anti-dilutive as Arconic generated a net loss. As a result, 26 million share equivalents related to mandatory convertible preferred stock, 7 million stock awards, 11 million stock options, and
5 million (weighted-average) share equivalents related to convertible debt (acquired from RTI  see Note F) were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. Had Arconic generated sufficient net income in 2015, 26 million,

5 million, 4 million, and 1 million potential shares of common stock related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock awards, and stock options,
respectively, would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding.  In 2014, 6 million and 7 million share equivalents
related to convertible notes and mandatory convertible preferred stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their effect was anti-dilutive.  Options to purchase 10 million, 9 million, and 1 million shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $26.93, $38.25, and $48.72 per share were outstanding as of
December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive, as the exercise prices of the options were greater than the average market price of Arconics common
stock.  R. Income Taxes  The

Includes U.S. taxes related to foreign income 
The exercise of employee stock options generated a tax benefit of $0, $2 and $8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing only the difference
between compensation expense recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. These amounts increased equity and either decreased current taxes payable or increased deferred tax assets (net operating losses) in the respective periods.
 Arconic has unamortized tax-deductible goodwill of $23 resulting from intercompany stock sales and reorganizations. Arconic recognizes the
tax benefits (at a 25% rate) associated with this tax-deductible goodwill as it is being amortized for local income tax purposes rather than in the period in which the transaction is consummated.

 In November 2014, Spain enacted corporate tax reform that changed the corporate tax rate from 30% in 2014 to 28% in 2015 to 25% in 2016. As a result,
Arconic remeasured certain deferred tax assets related to Spanish subsidiaries. In December 2016, Spain and the United States enacted tax law changes which resulted in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities recorded by Arconic.

 In 2014, a tax holiday for certain former Arconic subsidiaries in Brazil became effective (see below).

of Other relates to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes over an extended period of time as contributions are made to employee benefit plans and payments are made to
retirees.  The total deferred tax asset (net of valuation allowance) is supported by projections of future taxable income
exclusive of reversing temporary differences (59%) and taxable temporary differences that reverse within the carryforward period (41%). 
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be
realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable
income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward
period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconics experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence
includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no
valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and
negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to
reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays.  In 2016, Arconic recognized a $1,267
discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the Separation Transaction, including $925 with respect to Alcoa Corporations net deferred tax assets in the United States, $302 with respect to Arconics foreign tax credits
in the United States, $42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, and $(2) related to the net impact of other smaller items. After weighing all positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that the net
deferred tax assets of Alcoa Corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income. As such, a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation. 
Upon separation, Arconic retained foreign tax credits in the United States which have a 10-year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2017 to
2026 (as of December 31, 2016). Arconic also retained suspended foreign tax credit carryforwards whose expiration period begins when the credits become unsuspended. A valuation allowance of $135 was initially established in 2013 on a portion of
the foreign tax credit carryforwards, primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period. An incremental valuation allowance of $134 was recognized in 2015. At the end of
2015 and 2016, $15 and $128 of foreign tax credits respectively expired resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance. As a result of the Separation Transaction, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not
that Arconic would realize the full tax benefit of its foreign tax credit carryforwards based on changes in the availability of foreign sourced taxable income. After consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies
and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends, an incremental valuation allowance of $302 was recognized in 2016. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was $427.
The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances. 
In addition, Arconic recognized a $42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets
in Luxembourg. Sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the Separation Transaction. The need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in
future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.

Table of Contents
In 2016, Arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances
on certain net deferred tax assets in Russia and Canada of $19 and $20 respectively. After weighing all available evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying
deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historic cumulative income and projected taxable income.  Arconic also recorded additional
valuation allowances in Australia of $93 related to the Separation Transaction, in Spain of $163 related to a tax law change and in Luxembourg of $280 related to the Separation Transaction as well as a tax law change. These valuation allowances
fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction, resulting in no net impact to tax expense. The need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each
jurisdiction and, as a result, the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.  In 2015, Arconic
recognized an additional $141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Iceland and Suriname. Of this amount, an $85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in
Suriname, which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 (as of December 31, 2015). The remaining $56 charge relates to a valuation
allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in Iceland. These deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above,
management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business, combined with prior
year cumulative losses and a short expiration period.  In December 2011, one of Arconics former subsidiaries in Brazil applied for a tax
holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations. During 2013, the application was amended and re-filed and, separately, a similar application was filed for another one of Arconics former subsidiaries in Brazil. The deadline for
the Brazilian government to deny the application was July 11, 2014. Since Arconic did not receive notice that its applications were denied, the tax holiday took effect automatically on July 12, 2014. As a result, the tax rate applicable to
qualified holiday income for these subsidiaries decreased significantly (from 34% to 15.25%), resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10-year holiday period (retroactively effective as of January 1, 2013). Additionally, a portion of one
of the subsidiaries net deferred tax assets that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new tax rate (the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the
subsidiarys future earnings not subject to the tax holiday). This remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that subsidiarys net deferred tax assets and a noncash charge to earnings of $52 ($31 after noncontrolling interests).

 The cumulative amount of Arconics foreign undistributed net earnings for which no deferred taxes have been provided
was approximately $450 at December 31, 2016. Arconic has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Companys growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions. As such, management has no plans to distribute such earnings in the
foreseeable future, and, therefore, has determined it is not practicable to determine the related deferred tax liability.

Arconic and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and
foreign jurisdictions. With a few minor exceptions, Arconic is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2006. All U.S. tax years prior to 2016 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state
and foreign jurisdiction tax authorities are in the process of examining Arconics income tax returns for various tax years through 2015. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) was as follows:

 For all periods presented, a portion of the balance at end of year pertains to state tax liabilities, which are presented
before any offset for federal tax benefits. The effect of unrecognized tax benefits, if recorded, that would impact the annual effective tax rate for 2016, 2015, and 2014 would be approximately 6%, 7%, and 4%, respectively, of pretax book income.
Arconic does not anticipate that changes in its unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Statement of Consolidated Operations during 2017 (see Tax in Note L for a matter for which no reserve has been recognized). 
It is Arconics policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the Provision for income taxes on the
accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, Arconic did not recognize any interest or penalties. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, settlements with tax authorities, and refunded overpayments,
Arconic recognized interest income of $1 in 2015 but did not recognize any interest income in 2016 or 2014. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was $2 and $1, respectively. 
S. Receivables  Sale of Receivables
Programs  Arconic has an arrangement with three financial institutions to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a
revolving basis. The sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Arconic. This arrangement provides for minimum funding of $200 up to a maximum of $400
for receivables sold. On March 30, 2012, Arconic initially sold $304 of customer receivables in exchange for $50 in cash and $254 of deferred purchase price under this arrangement. Arconic has received additional net cash funding of $300 for
receivables sold ($1,758 in draws and $1,458 in repayments) since the programs inception, including $100 ($500 in draws and $400 in repayments) in 2016. No draws or repayments occurred in 2015. 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the deferred purchase price receivable was $83 and $249, respectively, which was included in Other receivables on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase price receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the
deferred purchase price receivable. The net change in the deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the (Increase) decrease in receivables line item on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This activity is reflected as an
operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant, short-term interest rate risk. 
  113



Table of Contents
In 2016 and 2015, the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase price receivable
were $5,340 and $5,406, respectively, and $6,893 and $7,001, respectively. The gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collected under this program since its inception was $29,938 and $29,505 respectively. Arconic services the customer
receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded.  Allowance for

 U. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  Arconic maintains pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in foreign locations. Pension benefits generally depend on length of service, job grade, and remuneration. Substantially
all benefits are paid through pension trusts that are sufficiently funded to ensure that all plans can pay benefits to retirees as they become due. Most salaried and non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after March 1, 2006 participate in
a defined contribution plan instead of a defined benefit plan.  Arconic also maintains health care and life insurance postretirement benefit
plans covering eligible U.S. retired employees and certain retirees from foreign locations. Generally, the medical plans are unfunded and pay a percentage of medical expenses, reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life benefits are generally
provided by insurance contracts. Arconic retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to change or eliminate these benefits. All salaried and certain non-bargaining hourly U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2002 and certain bargaining
hourly U.S. employees hired after July 1, 2010 are not eligible for postretirement health care benefits. All salaried and certain hourly U.S. employees that retire on or after April 1, 2008 are not eligible for postretirement life
insurance benefits.  Effective January 1, 2015, Arconic no longer offers postretirement health care benefits to Medicare-eligible,
primarily non-bargaining, U.S. retirees through Company-sponsored plans. Qualifying retirees (hired prior to January 1, 2002), both current and future, may access these benefits in the marketplace by purchasing coverage directly from
insurance carriers. This change resulted in the adoption of a significant plan amendment by certain Arconic U.S. postretirement benefit plans in August 2014. Accordingly, these plans were required to be remeasured. 
Effective August 1, 2016, in preparation for the Separation Transaction, certain U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans were separated,
requiring a remeasurement as of that date. Additionally, one pension plan was required to be remeasured as a result of settlement accounting. Together, these remeasurements resulted in an increase of $845 to Arconics pension liability and an
increase of $551 (net of tax) to the plans unrecognized net actuarial loss (included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss).

(1) 
 In 2016, 2015, and 2014, net periodic benefit cost for U.S pension plans was $261, $423, and $335, respectively. 


(2) 
 In 2016, 2015, and 2014, net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits reflects a reduction of $22, $34, and $38, respectively, related
to the recognition of the federal subsidy awarded under Medicare Part D. 


(3) 
 In 2016, settlements were due to workforce reductions (see Note D) and the payment of lump sum benefits and/or purchases of annuity contracts. In 2015,
settlements were due to workforce reductions (see Note D) and the payment of lump sum benefits and/or purchases of annuity contracts. In 2014, settlements were due to workforce reductions (see Note D). 


(4) 
 In 2015, curtailments were due to elimination of benefits or workforce reductions (see Note D). 


(5) 
 In 2016 and 2015, special termination benefits were due to workforce reductions (see Note D).

 The discount rate is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance
of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various
sectors, including finance and banking, consumer products, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 11 years, and the
underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Companys plans obligations multiple times.  The rate of compensation increase is based upon actual experience. For 2017, the rate of compensation increase will be 3.5%, which approximates the five-year average. 
Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans were as follows

In all periods presented, the respective discount rates were used to determine net periodic benefit cost for most U.S. pension plans for the full annual period.
However, the discount rates for a limited number of plans were updated during 2016, 2015, and 2014 to reflect the remeasurement of these plans due to new union labor agreements, settlements, and/or curtailments. The updated discount rates used were
not significantly different from the discount rates presented.  In conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status
of Arconics pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015, management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs is determined in 2016 and beyond. Previously, the
interest component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations. Under the new methodology, the interest cost component is determined by aggregating
the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate (referred to as the spot rate approach). This change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net
periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology of $84 for pension plans and $14 for other postretirement benefit plans. Management believes this new methodology, which represents a change in an accounting
estimate, is a better measure of the interest cost as each years cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year. 
  117



Table of Contents
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related
value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return
information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption. While consideration is given to recent
performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers
and consultants, as well as managements own judgment.  For 2016, 2015, and 2014, the expected long-term rate of return used by
management was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. These rates fell within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the
expected future return developed by asset class. In 2015, the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance. For 2017, management anticipates that 7.75%
will be the expected long-term rate of return.  Assumed health care cost trend rates for U.S. other postretirement benefit plans were as
follows (assumptions for non-U.S plans did not differ materially):

 The assumed health care cost trend rate is used to measure the expected cost of gross eligible charges covered by
Arconics other postretirement benefit plans. For 2017, a 5.5% trend rate will be used, reflecting managements best estimate of the change in future health care costs covered by the plans. The plans actual annual health care cost
trend experience over the past three years has ranged from 3.6%. to 9.6% Management does not believe this three-year range is indicative of expected increases for future health care costs over the long-term. 
Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in these assumed
rates would have the following effects:

The principal objectives underlying the investment of the pension plans assets are to ensure that
Arconic can properly fund benefit obligations as they become due under a broad range of potential economic and financial scenarios, maximize the long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on such obligations, and broadly
diversify investments across and within various asset classes to protect asset values against adverse movements. Specific objectives for long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities
and achieving risk factor diversification across the balance of the asset portfolio. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The investment strategy has used
long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities. Exposure to broad equity risk has been decreased and diversified through investments in discretionary and
systematic macro hedge funds, long/short equity hedge funds, and global and emerging market equities. Investments are further diversified by strategy, asset class, geography, and sector to enhance returns and mitigate downside risk. A large number
of external investment managers are used to gain broad exposure to the financial markets and to mitigate manager-concentration risk. 
Investment practices comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and other applicable laws and
regulations.  The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the trustees to measure the fair value of pension plan
assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified (see Note V for the definition of fair value and a description of the fair value hierarchy). 
Equities. These securities consist of: (i) direct investments in the stock of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. companies and are valued
based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded (generally classified in Level 1); (ii) the plans share of commingled funds that are invested in the stock of publicly traded companies
and are valued at the net asset value of shares held at December 31 (included in Level 1); and (iii) direct investments in long/short equity hedge funds and private equity (limited partnerships and venture capital partnerships) and are
valued by investment managers based on the most recent financial information available, which typically represents significant unobservable data.  Fixed income. These securities consist of: (i) U.S. government debt and are generally valued using quoted prices (included in Level 1); (ii) publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed
interest obligations (principally corporate bonds and debentures) and are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using quoted prices and other observable market data (included in Level 2); (iii) cash
and cash equivalents; and (iv) interest rate swaps and are generally valued using industry standard models with market-based observable inputs.  Other investments. These investments include, among others: (i) exchange traded funds, such as gold, and real estate investment trusts and are valued based on the closing price reported in an
active market on which the investments are traded (included in Level 1) and (ii) direct investments of discretionary and systematic macro hedge funds and private real estate (includes limited partnerships) and are valued by investment managers
based on the most recent financial information available, which typically represents significant unobservable data.  The fair value methods
described above may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Additionally, while Arconic believes the valuation methods used by the plans trustees are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

As of December 31, 2016, the total fair value of pension plans assets excludes a net receivable of $20, which represents assets due from the Alcoa
Corporation as a result of plan separations and securities sold not yet settled plus interest and dividends earned on various investments. 


**
As of December 31, 2015, the total fair value of pension plans assets excludes a net receivable of $2 which represents securities sold not yet settled plus
interest and dividends earned on various investments.  Funding and Cash Flows 
It is Arconics policy to fund amounts for pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable
country benefits laws and tax laws, including the Pension Protection Act of 2006; the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008; the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012; the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014; and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 for
U.S. plans. From time to time, Arconic contributes additional amounts as deemed appropriate. In 2016 and 2015, cash contributions to Arconics pension plans were $290 and $470. The minimum required contribution to pension plans in 2017 is
estimated to be $310, of which $290 is for U.S. plans.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation approved
managements plan to separate the Alcoa Inc. pension plans between Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction. The plan stipulates that Arconic will make cash contributions totaling $150 over a period of 30
months to its two largest pension plans. The payments are expected to be made in increments no less than $50 each over the 30-month period, with the first payment due no later than six months after the separation date of November 1, 2016.
 Benefit payments expected to be paid to pension and other postretirement benefit plans participants and expected Medicare Part D
subsidy receipts are as follows utilizing the current assumptions outlined above:

 Defined Contribution Plans  Arconic sponsors savings and investment plans in various countries, primarily in the United States. Expenses related to these plans were $71 in 2016, $83 in 2015, and $83 in 2014. In the United States,
employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, and Arconic matches a portion of these contributions in equivalent form of the investments elected by the employee.  V. Other Financial Instruments  Fair Value. Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (i) market participant assumptions developed based
on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (ii) an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).
The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  121



Table of Contents

(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
 


 

 
 Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
  


 

 
 Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
(e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   


 

 
 Level 3Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
The carrying values and fair values of Arconics financial instruments were as follows:

 The following methods were used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments: 
Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Short-term borrowings, and Commercial paper. The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of
the short maturity of the instruments. The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, and Commercial paper were classified in Level 1, and Short-term borrowings were classified in Level 2. 
Derivatives. The fair value of derivative contracts classified as Level 1 was based on identical unrestricted assets and liabilities. The fair
value of derivative contracts classified as Level 2 was based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates).  Noncurrent receivables. The fair value of noncurrent receivables was based on anticipated cash flows, which approximates carrying value, and was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
 Available-for-sale securities. The fair value of such securities was based on quoted market prices. These financial instruments
consist of exchange-traded fixed income and equity securities, which are carried at fair value and were classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  122



Table of Contents
Investment in common stock of Alcoa Corporation (see Note C). The fair value was based on the closing
stock price of Alcoa Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2016 multiplied by the number of shares of Alcoa Corporation stock owned by Arconic as of December 31, 2016. This investment was classified in Level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy.  Contingent payment related to an acquisition (see Note F). The fair value was based on the net present value of
expected future cash flows and was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Long-term debt due within one year and Long-term
debt, less amount due within one year. The fair value was based on quoted market prices for public debt and on interest rates that are currently available to Arconic for issuance of debt with similar terms and maturities for non-public debt. The
fair value amounts for all Long-term debt were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  W. Related Party Transactions
 On October 31, 2016, Arconic entered into several agreements with Alcoa Corporation that govern the relationship of the parties
following the completion of the Separation Transaction. These agreements include the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic
Inc. Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Arconic Inc. to Alcoa Corporation Patent, Know-How, and Trade Secret License Agreement, Alcoa Corporation to Arconic Inc. Trademark License Agreement, Toll Processing and Services Agreement,
Master Agreement for the Supply of Primary Aluminum, Massena Lease and Operations Agreement, Fusina Lease and Operations Agreement, and Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement.  Effective November 1, 2016, Arconic entered into a Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation for the tolling of metal for the Warrick, Indiana rolling mill which became a part of
Alcoa Corporation on the completion of the Separation Transaction. As part of this arrangement, Arconic will provide a toll processing service to Alcoa Corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in Tennessee through the expected end
date of the contract, December 31, 2018. Alcoa Corporation will supply all required raw materials to Arconic and Arconic will process the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer. Tolling revenues
for the two month period ending December 31, 2016 and accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 were not material to the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Additionally, Arconic buys products from and sells products to various related companies, including Alcoa Corporation, at negotiated prices between the
two parties. These transactions, including accounts payable, were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Arconic for all periods presented.  X. Subsequent Events  Management evaluated all activity of Arconic and concluded that no
subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, except as noted below: 
On February 14, 2017, Arconic sold 23,353,000 of its shares of Alcoa Corporation common stock at $38.03 per share which resulted in $888 in cash
proceeds and a pre-tax gain of approximately $350 to be recorded in Other income in the first quarter of 2017.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on
Accounting and Financial Disclosure.  None.  ",">Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Arconics Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report, and they have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective.  (b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form
10-K beginning on page 65.  (c) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting
Firm  The effectiveness of Arconics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K on page 66. 
(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.  ",">Item 9B.  Other Information. 
In connection with the Separation, Arconics Board of Directors conducted a special review of the Companys compensation arrangements, and on
January 13, 2017, it approved amendments to the Companys Change in Control Severance Plan (the CIC Plan) which took effect on February 27, 2017. Certain senior executives of the Company, including Klaus Kleinfeld, the Chief
Executive Officer, and Ken Giacobbe, the Chief Financial Officer, participate in the CIC Plan. Prior to the amendments, Mr. Kleinfeld was the sole participant in the CIC Plan who retained two grandfathered benefits under the plan  eligibility
for a golden parachute excise tax reimbursement, and the right to resign for any reason during a window of thirty days beginning six months following a change in control and receive severance benefits  which were previously eliminated from the
CIC Plan for new participants who became eligible on or after January 1, 2010. The amendments to the CIC Plan eliminated both of these grandfathered benefits for Mr. Kleinfeld. In addition, the amendments reduced the level of severance benefits for
participants in the CIC Plan below the level of Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, the severance benefits for which Mr. Giacobbe is potentially eligible under the amended CIC Plan are (i) a cash payment equal to two times annual salary plus
target annual cash incentive compensation (reduced from three times), (ii) continuation of health care benefits for two years (reduced from three years), (iii) two additional years of pension credit calculated as described in the CIC Plan (reduced
from three years), and (iv) six months of outplacement benefits (there was no change to this benefit).  Arconics Board of Directors also
approved, on January 13, 2017, the Arconic Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the Severance Plan), which took effect on February 27, 2017. The Severance Plan covers the same executives who are eligible to participate in the CIC Plan, other
than any such executive who is party to an individual agreement providing for severance benefits. Mr. Kleinfeld is party to an individual agreement, dated December 8, 2008, with the Company providing for severance benefits on an involuntary
termination of employment that are substantially similar to those 
  125



Table of Contents

provided under the Severance Plan, which are described below. Mr. Kleinfeld has waived the severance benefits under such individual agreement pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 27,
2017 (the Letter Agreement) and is therefore eligible to participate in the Severance Plan. The Severance Plan provides for severance benefits upon a termination of a participants employment without cause or resignation by a
participant for good reason (unless the participant receives severance benefits under the CIC Plan), subject to execution and non-revocation of a general release of legal claims against the Company. The severance benefits under the Severance Plan
for Messrs. Kleinfeld and Giacobbe are: (i) a cash severance payment equal to two times, for Mr. Kleinfeld, and one times, for Mr. Giacobbe, the sum of base salary and target annual cash incentive, (ii) continued health care benefits for a two-year
period, and (iii) two additional years of pension accrual calculated as described in the Severance Plan.  The foregoing descriptions of the
amendments to the CIC Plan, the Severance Plan and the Letter Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable documents filed as exhibits 10(x), 10(aa) and 10(y)(1),
respectively, to this Form 10-K.  On February 23, 2017, Arconics Board of Directors approved and adopted amended and restated by-laws
(the Amended By-laws) in order to provide eligible shareholders with a proxy access mechanism for nominating director candidates, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The proxy access provision allows
eligible shareholders or groups of up to 20 shareholders, who have maintained continuous qualifying ownership of at least 3% of the Companys outstanding common stock for at least three years and have complied with the other requirements set
forth in the Amended By-laws, to include director nominees for up to the greater of two candidates or 20% of the Board in the Companys proxy materials for an annual meeting of shareholders. The amendments also include certain conforming and
ministerial changes to certain advance notice provisions of the Amended By-laws.  In addition, the Amended By-laws provide that meetings of
shareholders may be held by means of the Internet or other electronic communications technology in the manner provided by Pennsylvania law. 
The Amended By-laws became effective immediately upon approval and adoption by the Board. The proxy access provision will be first available to
shareholders in connection with the Companys 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  The foregoing description of the Amended By-laws does
not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended By-laws filed as exhibit 3(b) to this Form 10-K.
